the highest estimates for the number of buddhists and shintoists in japan is
representing a large number of believers in a syncretism of both religions

taoism
confucianism and buddhism from china have also influenced japanese beliefs and customs

sweden
s prehistory begins in the aller

hunting camps of the bromme culture at the edge of the ice in what is now the country

this period was characterized by small bands of hunter

fishers using flint technology

along with monumental burial
polished flint axes and decorated pottery
arrived from the continent with the funnelbeaker culture in c
bc
sweden
s southern third was part of the stock
keeping and agricultural nordic bronze age culture
s area
most of it being peripheral to the culture
s danish centre
the period began in c
bc with the start of bronze imports from europe
copper mining was never tried locally during this period
and scandinavia has no tin deposits
so all metal had to be imported
the nordic bronze age was entirely pre
urban
with people living in hamlets and on farmsteads with single
story wooden long houses
in the absence of any roman occupation
sweden
s iron age is reckoned up to the introduction of stone architecture and monastic orders around the
th century
much of the period is proto

there are written sources

the climate took a turn for the worse
forcing farmers to keep cattle indoors over the winters
leading to an annual build
up of manure that could for the first time be used systematically for soil improvement
a roman attempt to move the imperial border forward from the rhine to the elbe was aborted in ad
when germans under roman
trained leadership defeated the legions of varus by ambush in the battle of the teutoburg forest
about this time
there was a major shift in the material culture of scandinavia
reflecting increased contact with the romans
starting in the
nd century
much of southern sweden
s agricultural land was parcelled out with low stone walls
they divided the land into permanent infields and meadows for winter fodder on one side of the wall
and wooded outland where the cattle grazed on the other side
this principle of landscape organization survived into the
th century
the roman period also saw the first large
scale expansion of agricultural settlement up the baltic coast of the country

sweden enters proto
history with the germania of tacitus in ad

suiones
as a powerful tribe
distinguished not merely for their arms and men
but for their powerful fleets
with ships that had a prow in both ends
longships
which kings
kuningaz
ruled these suiones is unknown
but norse mythology presents a long line of legendary and semi
legendary kings going back to the last centuries bc
as for literacy in sweden itself
the runic script was invented among the south scandinavian elite in the
nd century
but all that has come down to the present from the roman period is curt inscriptions on artefacts
mainly of male names
demonstrating that the people of south scandinavia spoke proto
norse at the time
a language ancestral to swedish and other north germanic languages

has very fine horses just as the

tribe
alia vero gens ibi moratur suehans
quae velud thyringi equis utuntur eximiis
snorri sturluson wrote that the contemporary swedish king adils
eadgils
had the finest horses of his days
the suehans were the suppliers of black fox skins for the roman market
then jordanes names the suetidi which is considered to be the latin form of svitjod
he writes that the suetidi are the tallest of men together with the dani who were of the same stock

early swedish history
foundation of modern sweden
and varangians
the swedish viking age lasted roughly between the eighth and eleventh centuries
during this period
it is believed that the swedes expanded from eastern sweden and incorporated the geats to the south
it is believed that swedish vikings and gutar mainly travelled east and south
going to finland
the baltic countries
russia
belarus
ukraine the black sea and further as far as baghdad
their routes passed through the dnieper down south to constantinople
on which they did numerous raids
the byzantine emperor theophilos noticed their great skills in war and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard
known as the varangian guard
the swedish vikings
called
rus
are also believed to be the founding fathers of kievan rus
the arabic traveller
ibn fadlan
described these vikings as following
i have seen the rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the itil
i have never seen more perfect physical specimens
tall as date palms
blond and ruddy
they wear neither tunics nor caftans
but the men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free
each man has an axe
a sword
and a knife
and keeps each by him at all times
the swords are broad and grooved
of frankish sort
the adventures of these swedish vikings are commemorated on many runestones in sweden
such as the greece runestones and the varangian runestones
there was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards
which are commorated on stones such as the england runestones
the last major swedish viking expedition appears to have been the ill
fated expedition of ingvar the far
travelled to serkland
the region south
east of the caspian sea
its members are commemorated on the ingvar runestones
none of which mentions any survivor
what happened to the crew is unknown
but it is believed that they died of sickness

ystad in scania and paviken on gotland
in present
day sweden
were flourishing trade centres
remains of what is believed to have been a large market have been found in ystad dating from
ad
in paviken
an important centre of trade in the baltic region during the ninth and tenth century
remains have been found of a large viking age harbour with shipbuilding yards and handicraft industries
between
and
trade brought an abundance of silver to gotland
and according to some scholars
the gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of scandinavia combined
st
ansgar introduced christianity in
but the new religion did not begin to fully replace paganism until the
th century
during the
th century
christianity became the most prevalent religion
and from
sweden is counted as a christian nation
the period between
and
was characterized by internal power struggles and competition among the nordic kingdoms
swedish kings also began to expand the swedish
controlled territory in finland
creating conflicts with the rus who no longer had any connection with sweden
except for the province of skane
on the southern most tip of sweden which was under danish control during this time
feudalism never developed in sweden as it did in the rest of europe
therefore
the peasantry remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of swedish history
slavery
also called thralldom
was not common in sweden
and what slavery there was tended to be driven out of existence by the spread of christianity
the difficulty in obtaining slaves from the lands east of the baltic sea
and by the development of cities before the
th century indeed
both slavery and serfdom were abolished altogether by a decree of king magnus erickson in
former slaves tended to be absorbed into the peasantry and some were became laborers in the towns
still
sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the means of exchange
for instance
the farmers of the province of dalsland would transport their butter to the mining districts of sweden and exchange it there for iron
which they would then take down to the coast and trade the iron for fish they needed for food while the iron would be shipped abroad
valdemar iv takes control over swedish gotland
the final fight outside the walls of visby ended with a total massacre of
gotlanders
in the
th century
sweden was struck by the black death
the population of sweden was decimated
during this period the swedish cities also began to acquire greater rights and were strongly influenced by german merchants of the hanseatic league
active especially at visby
in
sweden and norway were united under king magnus eriksson
and in
queen margaret i of denmark effected the personal union of sweden
norway
and denmark through the kalmar union
however
margaret
s successors
whose rule was also centred in denmark
were unable to control the swedish nobility
real power was held for long periods by regents
notably those of the sture family
chosen by the swedish parliament
king christian ii of denmark
who asserted his claim to sweden by force of arms
ordered a massacre in
of swedish nobles at stockholm
this came to be known as the
stockholm blood bath
and stirred the swedish nobility to new resistance and
on
june
now sweden
s national holiday
in
they made gustav vasa their king
this is sometimes considered as the foundation of modern sweden
shortly afterwards he rejected catholicism and led sweden into the protestant reformation
economically
gustav vasa broke the monopoly of the hanseatic league over swedish baltic sea trade
the hanseatic league had been officially formed at lubeck on the northern coast of germany in
the league sought privileges from the princes and royalty of the countries and cities along the coasts of the baltic sea
in exchange they offered a certain amount of protection
having their own navy the hansa were able to sweep the baltic sea free of pirates
the privileges obtained by the hansa included assurances that only hansa citizens would be allowed to trade from the ports where they were located
they also sought agreement to be free of all customs and taxes
with these concessions
lubeck merchants flocked to stockholm
sweden and soon came to dominate the economic life of that city and made the port city of stockholm into the leading commercial and industrial city of sweden
under the hanseatic trade
rds of stockholm
s imports consisted of textiles and
of salt
exports from sweden consisted of iron and copper
however
the swedes began to resent the monopoly trading position of the hansa
mostly german citizens
and to resent the income they felt they lost to the hansa
consequently
when gustav vasa or gustav i broke the monopoly power of the hanseatic league he was regarded as a hero to the swedish people
history now views gustav i as the father of the modern swedish nation
the foundations laid by gustave would take time to develop
furthermore
when sweden did develop
freed itself from the hanseatic league and entered its golden era
the fact the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed back to them rather than going to a feudal landowning class
this was not the case in other countries of europe like poland were the peasantry was still bound by serfdom and a strong feudalistic land owning system

instead turning against poland
lithuania and defeating the polish king augustus ii and his saxon allies at the battle of kliszow in

in interest of reestablishing swedish dominance in the baltic sea

sweden remained officially neutral during world war i and world war ii
although its neutrality during world war ii has been disputed
sweden was under german influence for much of the war
as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades
the swedish government felt that it was in no position to openly contest germany
and therefore made some concessions
sweden also supplied steel and machined parts to germany throughout the war
however
sweden supported norwegian resistance
and in
helped rescue danish jews from deportation to concentration camps
toward the end of the war
sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts and many refugees
among them many jews from nazi
occupied europe
were saved partly because of the swedish involvement in rescue missions at the internment camps and partly because sweden served as a haven for refugees
primarily from the nordic countries and the baltic states

internal and external critics have argued that sweden could have done more to resist the nazi war effort

political history
kingdoms of svear
swedish
and g
tar
geats
in the
th century
with modern borders in grey
the actual age of the kingdom of sweden is unknown
it depends mostly on whether sweden should be considered a nation when the svear
swedes
ruled svealand or if the emergence of the nation started with the svear and the g
tar
geats
of g
taland being united under one ruler
in the first case
sweden was first mentioned as having one single ruler in the year
by tacitus
but it is almost impossible to know for how long it had been this way
however
historians usually start the line of swedish monarchs from when svealand and g
taland were ruled under the same king
namely erik the victorious and his son olof sk
tkonung in the
th century
these events are often described as the consolidation of sweden
although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later
earlier kings
for which no reliable historical sources exist
can be read about in mythical kings of sweden and semi
legendary kings of sweden
many of these kings are only mentioned in various saga and blend with norse mythology

of the goths and wends

the present king of sweden
carl xvi gustaf
was the first monarch officially proclaimed
king of sweden
sveriges konung
with no additional peoples mentioned in his title
the term riksdag was used for the first time in the
although the first meeting where representatives of different social groups were called to discuss and determine affairs affecting the country as a whole took place as early as
in the town of arboga
during the assemblies of
and
under king gustav vasa
representatives of all four estates of the realm
clergy
nobility
townsmen and peasants
were called on to participate for the first time
the monarchy became hereditary in
executive power was historically shared between the king and a noble privy council until
followed by the king
s autocratic rule initiated by the common estates of the parliament
as a reaction to the failed great northern war
a parliamentary system was introduced in
followed by three different flavours of constitutional monarchy in
and
the latter granting several civil liberties
the monarch remains as the formal
but merely symbolic
head of state with ceremonial duties
the riksdag of the estates consisted of two chambers

sweden became a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliament

acts of the parliament and government decrees can be made inapplicable at every level if they are manifestly against constitutional laws

because of the restrictions in this form of judicial review and a weak judiciary
this has had little practical consequence
legislation may be initiated by the cabinet or by members of parliament
members are elected on the basis of proportional representation for a four

foreign policy
main article
foreign relations of sweden
throughout the twentieth century
swedish foreign policy was based on the principle of non
alignment in peacetime and neutrality in wartime
sweden
s government was left to pursue an independent course based on a foreign policy defined as nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war
sweden
s doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the
th century as the country has not been in a state of war since the end of the swedish campaign against norway in
during world war ii sweden joined neither the allied nor axis powers
this has sometimes been disputed since in effect sweden allowed in select cases the nazi regime to use its railroad system to transport troops and goods
especially iron ore from mines in northern sweden
which was vital to the german war machine
during the early cold war era
sweden combined its policy of non
alignment with a low profile in international affairs
although it also pursued a security policy based on strong national defence to deter attack
at the same time
the country maintained relatively close informal connections with the western bloc
especially in the realm of intelligence exchange
in
a swedish dc
was shot down over the baltic sea by a soviet mig
jet fighter
later investigations revealed that the plane was actually gathering information for nato
another plane
a catalina search and rescue plane
was sent out a few days later and shot down by the soviets as well
olof palme
the former prime minister of sweden
visited cuba during the
s and showed his support for cuba in his speech
beginning in the late
sweden for a period attempted to play a more significant and independent role in international relations
this involved significant activity in international peace efforts
especially through the united nations
and in support to the third world
since the assassination of olof palme in
and the end of the cold war
this has been significantly toned down
although sweden remains comparatively active in peace keeping missions and maintains a generous foreign aid budget
in
a soviet whiskey class submarine ran aground close to the swedish naval base at karlskrona in the southern part of the country
it has never been clearly established whether the submarine ended up on the shoals through a navigational mistake or if it was a matter of espionage against swedish military potential
the incident triggered a diplomatic crisis between sweden and the soviet union
since
sweden has been a member of the european union
and as a consequence of a new world security situation the country
s foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified

d during the country
s early critical years of industrialisation
after world war ii a succession of governments increased the welfare state and the tax burden and sweden
s economic growth was one of the highest in the industrial world

consequently many of the citizens of the former slave nations of the british empire are descended from a nigerian ethnic group
britain abolished its slave trade in
and
following the napoleonic wars
established the west africa squadron in an attempt to halt the international traffic in slaves

which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern nigeria
on january
nigeria became a british protectorate
part of the british empire
the foremost world power at the time
many wars against subjugation had been fought by the states of what later became nigeria against the british empire in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century
notably of those were the british conquest of benin in
and the anglo
aro war from
the restraint or complete destruction of these states opened up the niger area to british rule
in
the niger area was formally united as the colony and protectorate of nigeria
administratively
nigeria remained divided into the northern and southern provinces and lagos colony
western education and the development of a modern economy proceeded more rapidly in the south than in the north
with consequences felt in nigeria
s political life ever since
slavery was not finally outlawed in northern nigeria until
following world war ii
in response to the growth of nigerian nationalism and demands for independence
successive constitutions legislated by the british government moved nigeria toward self
government on a representative and increasingly federal basis
by the middle of the
th century
the great wave for independence was sweeping across africa

were sharp
an imbalance was created in the polity by the result of the
plebiscite
southern cameroon opted to join the republic of cameroon while northern cameroon chose to remain in nigeria

the disequilibrium and perceived corruption of the electoral and political process led in
to several back

the coup was counter
acted by another successful plot
supported primarily by northern military officers and northerners who favoured the npc
it was engineered by northern officers
which allowed lt colonel yakubu gowon to become head of state
this sequence of events led to an increase in ethnic tension and violence

which was mostly motivated by ethnic and religious reasons was a bloodbath of both military officers and civilians
especially those of igbo extraction

rich niger delta flowed into the coffers of the nigerian state
however
increasing corruption and graft at all levels of government squandered most of these earnings
citation needed
the northern military clique benefited immensely from the oil boom to the detriment of the nigerian people and economy
as oil revenues fuelled the rise of federal subventions to states and precariously to individuals
the federal government soon became the centre of political struggle and the centre became the threshold of power in the country
as oil production and revenue rose
the nigerian government created a dangerous situation as it became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and the international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns eschewing economic stability
that spelled doom to federalism in nigeria
beginning in
nigerians participated in a brief return to democracy when obasanjo transferred power to the civilian regime of shehu shagari
the shagari government was viewed as corrupt and incompetent by virtually all sectors of nigerian society
so when the regime was overthrown by the military coup of mohammadu buhari shortly after the regime
s fraudulent re
election in
it was generally viewed as a positive development by most of the population
buhari promised major reforms but his government fared little better than its predecessor
and his regime was overthrown by yet another military coup in
the new head of state
ibrahim babangida
promptly declared himself president and commander in chief of the armed forces and the ruling supreme military council and also set
as the official deadline for a return to democratic governance
babangida
s tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity
he instituted the international monetary fund
s structural adjustment program
sap
to aid in the repayment of the country
s crushing international debt
which most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing
he also inflamed religious tensions in the nation and particularly the south by enrolling nigeria in the organization of the islamic conference
after babangida survived an abortive coup
he pushed back the promised return to democracy to
when free and fair elections were finally held on the
th of june
babangida declared that the results showing a presidential victory for moshood kashimawo olawale abiola null and void
sparking mass civilian violence in protest which effectively shut down the country for weeks and forced babangida to keep his shaky promise to relinquish office to a civilian run government
babangida
s regime is adjudged to be at the apogee of corruption in the history of the nation as it was during his time that corruption became officially diluted in nigeria
babangida
s caretaker regime headed by ernest shonekan survived only until late
when general sani abacha took power in another military coup
abacha proved to be perhaps nigeria
s most brutal ruler and employed violence on a wide scale to suppress the continuing pandemic of civilian unrest
money had been found in various western european countries banks traced to him
he avoided coup plots by bribing army generals
several hundred millions dollars in accounts traced to him were unearthed in
the regime would come to an end in
when the dictator was found dead amid dubious circumstances

nigeria is a federal republic modelled after the united states

the current president of nigeria is goodluck jonathan
who succeeded to the office in
the president presides as both head of state and head of the national executive and is elected by popular vote to a maximum of two four
year terms
the president
s power is checked by a senate and a house of representatives
which are combined in a bicameral body called the national assembly
the senate is a
seat body with three members from each state and one from the capital region of abuja
members are elected by popular vote to four
year terms
the house contains
seats and the number of seats per state is determined by population
ethnocentrism
tribalism
religious persecution
and prebendalism have played a visible role in nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in
kin
selective altruism has made its way into nigerian politics and has spurned various attempts by tribalists to concentrate federal power to a particular region of their interests
nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as massob
nationalist movements such as oodua peoples congress

foreign relations of nigeria
upon gaining independence in
nigeria made the liberation and restoration of the dignity of africa the centrepiece of its foreign policy and played a leading role in the fight against the apartheid regime in south africa
one notable exception to the african focus of nigeria
s foreign policy was the close relationship the country enjoyed with israel throughout the
with the latter country sponsoring and overseeing the construction of nigeria
s parliament buildings
nigeria
s foreign policy was soon tested in the
s after the country emerged united from its own civil war and quickly committed itself to the liberation struggles going on in the southern africa sub
region
though nigeria never sent an expeditionary force in that struggle
it offered more than rhetoric to the african national congress
anc
by taking a committed tough line with regard to the racist regime and their incursions in southern africa
in addition to expediting large sums to aid anti
colonial struggles
nigeria was also a founding member of the organisation for african unity
now the african union
and has tremendous influence in west africa and africa on the whole
nigeria has additionally founded regional cooperative efforts in west africa
functioning as standard
bearer for ecowas and ecomog
economic and military organizations respectively
with this african
centred stance
nigeria readily sent troops to the congo at the behest of the united nations shortly after independence
and has maintained membership since that time
nigeria also supported several pan african and pro
self government causes in the
including garnering support for angola
s mpla
swapo in namibia
and aiding anti
colonial struggles in mozambique
and zimbabwe
then rhodesia
military and economically
nigeria retains membership in the non
aligned movement
and in late november
organized an africa
south america summit in abuja to promote what some attendees termed
south

linkages on a variety of fronts
nigeria is also a member of the international criminal court
and the commonwealth of nations
from which it was temporarily expelled in
under the abacha regime
nigeria has remained a key player in the international oil industry since the
and maintains membership in organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec which it joined in july
its status as a major petroleum producer figures prominently in its sometimes vicissitudinous international relations with both developed countries
notably the united states and more recently china and developing countries
notably ghana
jamaica and kenya
millions of nigerians have emigrated at times of economic hardship to europe
north america and australia among others

waste management including sewage treatment
the linked processes of deforestation and soil degradation
and climate change or global warming are the major environmental problems in nigeria
waste management presents problems in a mega city like lagos and other major nigerian cities which are linked with economic development
population growth and the inability of municipal councils to manage the resulting rise in industrial and domestic waste
haphazard industrial planning
increased urbanization
poverty and lack of competence of the municipal government are seen as the major reasons for high levels of waste pollution in major nigerian cities
some of the
solutions
have been disastrous to the environment
resulting in untreated waste being dumped in places where it can pollute waterways and groundwater
in terms of global warming
africans contribute only about one metric ton of carbon dioxide per person per year
it is perceived by many climate change experts that food production and security in the northern sahel region of the country will suffer as semi

based healthcare reform
resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services
a comprehensive approach strategy was extended to all areas of health care
with subsequent improvement in the health care indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost

names for association football
the rules of football were codified in england by the football association in
and the name association football was coined to distinguish the game from the other forms of football played at the time
specifically rugby football
the term soccer originated in england
first appearing in the
s as an oxford
er
abbreviation of the word
association
often credited to former england captain charles wreford
brown
today the sport is known as football in english
speaking countries in which it is the most popular football code
where other codes are more popular
the sport is more commonly referred to as soccer
non

gameplay
a goalkeeper saving a close
range shot from inside the penalty area
football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the laws of the game
the game is played using a single spherical ball
known as the football or soccer ball
two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team
s goal
between the posts and under the bar
thereby scoring a goal
the team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner
if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw
each team is led by a captain
the primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play
though they do use their hands during a throw
in restart
although players usually use their feet to move the ball around
they may use any part of their bodies other than their hands or arms
within normal play
all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch
though the ball cannot be received in an offside position
in typical game play
players attempt to create goal
scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball
such as by dribbling
passing the ball to a team
mate
and by taking shots at the goal
which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper
opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball
however
physical contact between opponents is restricted
football is generally a free
flowing game
with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee
after a stoppage
play recommences with a specified restart
a goalkeeper dives to stop the ball from entering his goal
at a professional level
most matches produce only a few goals
for example
the
season of the english premier league produced an average of
goals per match
the laws of the game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper
but a number of specialised roles have evolved
broadly
these include three main categories
strikers
or forwards
whose main task is to score goals
defenders
who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring
and midfielders
who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball in order to pass it to the forwards on their team
players in these positions are referred to as outfield players
in order to discern them from the single goalkeeper
these positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time
for example
there are central defenders
and left and right midfielders
the ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination
the number of players in each position determines the style of the team
s play
more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive
minded game
while the reverse creates a slower
more defensive style of play
while players typically spend most of the game in a specific position
there are few restrictions on player movement
and players can switch positions at any time
the layout of a team
s players is known as a formation
defining the team
s formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team

first drawn up at cambridge university in
were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes
including association football
the cambridge rules were written at trinity college

at a meeting attended by representatives from eton
harrow
rugby
winchester and shrewsbury schools
they were not universally adopted
during the
many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the english

to play various forms of football
some came up with their own distinct codes of rules
most notably the sheffield football club
formed by former public school pupils in
which led to formation of a sheffield fa in
in
john charles thring of uppingham school also devised an influential set of rules
these ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of the football association
the fa
in
which first met on the morning of
october
at the freemasons
tavern in great queen street
london
the only school to be represented on this occasion was charterhouse
the freemason
s tavern was the setting for five more meetings between october and december
which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules
at the final meeting
the first fa treasurer
the representative from blackheath
withdrew his club from the fa over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting
the first allowed for running with the ball in hand
the second for obstructing such a run by hacking
kicking an opponent in the shins
tripping and holding
other english rugby football clubs followed this lead and did not join the fa
or subsequently left the fa and instead in
formed the rugby football union
the eleven remaining clubs
under the charge of ebenezer cobb morley
went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game
these rules included handling of the ball by
marks
and the lack of a crossbar
rules which made it remarkably similar to victorian rules football being developed at that time in australia
the sheffield fa played by its own rules until the

today
football is played at a professional level all over the world
millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams
while billions more watch the game on television
a very large number of people also play football at an amateur level
according to a survey conducted by fifa published in
over
million people from more than
countries regularly play football
while football has the highest global television audience in sport
its simple rules and minimal equipment requirements at amateur level
have no doubt aided its growth in terms of participation
in many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans
local communities
and even nations
the c

by contrast
football is widely considered to be the final proximate cause in the football war in june
between el salvador and honduras
the sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the yugoslav wars of the

laws
there are seventeen laws in the official laws of the game
the same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football
although certain modifications for groups such as juniors
seniors
women and people with physical disabilities are permitted
the laws are often framed in broad terms
which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game
in addition to the seventeen laws
numerous ifab decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football
the laws of the game are published by fifa
but are maintained by the international football association board
not fifa itself
the most complex of the laws is offside
the offside law limits the ability of attacking players to receive the ball when closer to the opponent

headgear is not a required piece of basic equipment
but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury
players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player
such as jewellery or watches
the goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials
a number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game
the maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three
though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches
common reasons for a substitution include injury
tiredness
ineffectiveness
a tactical switch
or timewasting at the end of a finely poised game
in standard adult matches
a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match
if any team is unable to field at least seven players due to players being injured or sent
off
the referee will stop the game
the game will be declared as a loss against the team who were unable to field the required number of players

pitch
main article
association football pitch
standard pitch measurements
see imperial version
as the laws were formulated in england
and were initially administered solely by the four british football associations within ifab
the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units
the laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents
followed by traditional units in brackets
though popular use tends to continue to use traditional units in english
speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication
such as britain
the length of the pitch for international adult matches is in the range of
yd
and the width is in the range of
yd
fields for non
international matches may be
yd
length and
yd
in width
provided that the pitch does not become square
in
the ifab set a fixed size of
m long and
m wide as a standard pitch dimension for a international matches
the longer boundary lines are touchlines
while the shorter boundaries
on which the goals are placed
are goal lines
a rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line
the inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be
yd
apart
and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be
ft
above the ground
nets are usually placed behind the goal
but are not required by the laws
in front of each goal is an area known as the penalty area
this area is marked by the goal line
two lines starting on the goal line
yd
from the goalposts and extending
yd
into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line
and a line joining them
this area has a number of functions
the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick
other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick
offs
goal kicks
penalty kicks and corner kicks

duration and tie
breaking methods
a standard adult football match consists of two periods of
minutes each
known as halves
each half runs continuously
meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play
there is usually a
minute half
time break between halves
the end of the match is known as full
time
the referee is the official timekeeper for the match
and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions
injured players requiring attention
or other stoppages
this added time is commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time
and is at the sole discretion of the referee
the referee alone signals the end of the match
in matches where a fourth official is appointed
toward the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add
the fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number
the signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee
added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in
during a match between stoke and aston villa
trailing
and with just two minutes remaining
stoke were awarded a penalty
villa
s goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground
and by the time the ball had been recovered
the
minutes had elapsed and the game was over
the same law also stands that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed
thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken
in league competitions
games may end in a draw
but in some knockout competitions if a game is tied at the end of regulation time it may go into extra time
which consists of two further
minute periods
if the score is still tied after extra time
some competitions allow the use of penalty shootouts
known officially in the laws of the game as
kicks from the penalty mark
to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament
goals scored during extra time periods count toward the final score of the game
but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament
with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score
in competitions using two
legged matches
each team competes at home once
with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses
where aggregates are equal
the away goals rule may be used to determine the winners
in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg played away from home
if the result is still equal
kicks from the penalty mark are usually required
though some competitions may require a tied game to be replayed
in the late
s and early
the ifab experimented with ways of creating a winner without requiring a penalty shootout
which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match
these involved rules ending a game in extra time early
either when the first goal in extra time was scored
golden goal
or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time
silver goal
golden goal was used at the world cup in
and
the first world cup game decided by a golden goal was france
s victory over paraguay in
germany was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition
beating czech republic in the final of euro
silver goal was used in euro
both these experiments have been discontinued by ifab

misconduct
players are cautioned with a yellow card
and sent off with a red card
these colours were first introduced at the
fifa world cup and used consistently since
a player scores a penalty kick given after an offence is committed inside the penalty area
a foul occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the laws of the game while the ball is in play
the offences that constitute a foul are listed in law
handling the ball deliberately
tripping an opponent
or pushing an opponent
are examples of
penal fouls
punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred
other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick
the referee may punish a player or substitute
s misconduct by a caution
yellow card
or sending
off
red card
a second yellow card at the same game leads to a red card
and therefore to a sending
off
a player given a yellow card is said to have been
booked
the referee writing the player
s name in his official notebook
if a player has been sent off
no substitute can be brought on in their place
misconduct may occur at any time
and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed
the definitions are broad
in particular
the offence of
unsporting behaviour
may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game
even if they are not listed as specific offences
a referee can show a yellow or red card to a player
substitute or substituted player
non
players such as managers and support staff cannot be shown the yellow or red card
but may be expelled from the technical area if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner
rather than stopping play
the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed
this is known as
playing an advantage
the referee may
call back
play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within a short period
typically taken to be four to five seconds
even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played
the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play

the governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season
normally comprising several divisions
in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results
teams are placed into tables
placing them in order according to points accrued
most commonly
each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season
in a round
robin tournament
at the end of a season
the top team is declared the champion
the top few teams may be promoted to a higher division
and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division
the teams finishing at the top of a country
s league may be eligible also to play in international club competitions in the following season
the main exceptions to this system occur in some latin american leagues
which divide football championships into two sections named apertura and clausura

the majority of countries supplement the league system with one or more
cup
competitions
these are organised on a knock

american football
known in the united states simply as football and often as gridiron outside the united states
is a competitive team sport known for combining strategy with physical play
the objective of the game is to score points by advancing the ball into the opposing team
s end zone
the ball can be advanced by carrying it
a running play
or by throwing it to a teammate
a passing play
points can be scored in a variety of ways
including carrying the ball over the opponent
s goal line
catching a pass thrown over that goal line
kicking the ball through the goal posts at the opponent
s end zone
or tackling an opposing ball carrier within his end zone
the winner is the team with the most points when the time expires
american football is closely related to canadian football but with some differences in rules and in the configuration of the field
in the united states
the major forms are high school football
college football and professional football
which are essentially similar but feature slightly different rules
high school football is governed in the u
by the national federation of state high school associations
college football is governed in the u
by two bodies
the national collegiate athletic association and the national association of intercollegiate athletics
the major league for professional football is the national football league
over the years
there have been other notable professional football leagues
including the all america football conference during the
the american football league during the
the united states football league during the
and the currently active united football league
the sport is also played outside the united states
national professional and collegiate leagues exist in united kingdom

history of american football
an american football team at the turn of the twentieth century
note the continued use of a rugby
type ball
front row
right
the history of american football can be traced to early versions of rugby football and association football
both games have their origins in varieties of football played in the united kingdom in the mid
th century
in which a ball is kicked at a goal and
or run over a line
many games known as
football
were being played at colleges and universities in the united states in the first half of the
th century
walter camp
american football resulted from several major divergences from rugby football
most notably the rule changes instituted by walter camp
considered the
father of american football
among these important changes were the introduction of the line of scrimmage and of down
and
distance rules
in the late
th and early
th centuries
game play developments by college coaches such as eddie cochems
amos alonzo stagg
knute rockne
and glenn
pop
warner helped take advantage of the newly introduced forward pass
the popularity of collegiate football grew as it became the dominant version of the sport for the first half of the twentieth century
bowl games
a college football tradition
attracted a national audience for collegiate teams
bolstered by fierce rivalries
college football still holds widespread appeal in the us
the origin of professional football can be traced back to
with william
pudge
heffelfinger
contract to play in a game for the allegheny athletic association against the pittsburgh athletic club
the first professional
league
was the ohio league
formed in
and the first professional football championship game was between the buffalo prospects and the canton bulldogs in
in
the american professional football association was formed
the first game was played in dayton
ohio on october
with the host triangles defeating the columbus panhandles
the league changed its name to the national football league
nfl
two years later
and eventually became the major league of american football
initially a sport of midwestern industrial towns in the united states
professional football eventually became a national phenomenon
football
s increasing popularity is usually traced to the
nfl championship game
a contest that has been dubbed the
greatest game ever played
a rival league to the nfl
the american football league
afl
began play in
the pressure it put on the senior league led to a merger between the two leagues and the creation of the super bowl
which has become the most watched television event in the united states on an annual basis

american football rules
field and players
the numbers on the field indicate the number of yards to the nearest end zone
american football is played on a field
by
feet
by
the longer boundary lines are sidelines
while the shorter boundary lines are end lines
sidelines and end lines are out of bounds
near each end of the field is a goal line
they are
yards
apart
a scoring area called an end zone extends
yards
beyond each goal line to each end line
the end zone includes the goal line but not the end line
while the playing field is effectively flat
it is common for a field to be built with a slight crown
with the middle of the field higher than the sides
to allow water to drain from the field
yard lines cross the field every
yards
and are numbered every
yards from each goal line to the
yard line
or midfield
similar to a typical rugby league field
two rows of short lines
known as inbounds lines or hash marks
run at
yard
cm
intervals perpendicular to the sidelines near the middle of the field
all plays start with the ball on or between the hash marks
because of the arrangement of the lines
the field is occasionally referred to as a gridiron
at the back of each end zone are two goalposts
also called uprights
connected by a crossbar
feet
from the ground
for high skill levels
the posts are
feet
inches
apart
for lower skill levels
these are widened to
feet
inches
each team has
players on the field at a time
usually there are many more players off the field
there are at least
active players on an nfl team
however
if time allows
teams may substitute for any or all of their players during the breaks between plays
as a result
players have very specialized roles and are divided into three separate units
the offense
the defense and the special teams
although this is rare
in some games
almost all of the players will play during the course of the game
start of halves
similarly to association football
the game begins with a coin toss to determine which team will kick off to begin the game and which goal each team will defend
the options are presented again to start the second half
the choices for the first half do not automatically determine the start of the second half
the referee conducts the coin toss with the captains
or sometimes coaches
of the opposing teams
the team that wins the coin toss has three options
they may choose whether to kick or receive the opening kickoff
they may choose which goal to defend
they may choose to defer the first choice to the other team and have first choice to start the second half
whatever the first team chooses
the second team has the option on the other choice
for example
if the first team elects to receive at the start of the game
the second team can decide which goal to defend
at the start of the second half
the options to kick
receive
or choose a goal to defend are presented to the captains again
the team which did not choose first to start the first half
or which deferred its privilege to choose first
now gets first choice of options
game duration
a standard football game consists of four
minute quarters
minute quarters in high
school football and often shorter at lower levels
with a
minute half
time intermission after the second quarter
the clock stops after certain plays
therefore
a game can last considerably longer
often more than three hours in real time
and if a game is broadcast on television
tv timeouts are taken at certain intervals of the game to broadcast commercials outside of game action
if an nfl game is tied after four quarters
the teams play an additional period lasting up to
minutes
in a regular season nfl overtime game
the first team that scores wins
even if the other team does not get a possession
this is referred to as sudden death
however
in a post
season nfl game during the playoffs
if the first team with possession scores only a field goal
the other team is allowed the opportunity to match or better this score
this rule only affects playoff games in overtime in which the first team with possession scores a field goal
if the first team with possession scores a touchdown
the sudden death rules take effect
in a regular
season nfl game
if neither team scores in overtime
the game is a tie
in an nfl playoff game
additional overtime periods are played
as needed
to determine a winner
college overtime rules are more complicated and are described in overtime
sport
a line of scrimmage on the
yard line
the offense is on the left
a quarterback searching for opportunity to throw a pass
a running back being tackled when he tries to run with the ball
a quarterback preparing to throw a pass
forward pass in progress
during practice
a kicker attempts an extra point
advancing the ball
advancing the ball in american football resembles the six
tackle rule and the play
the
ball in rugby league
the team that takes possession of the ball
the offense
has four attempts
called downs
in which to advance the ball at least
yards
toward their opponent
the defense
end zone
when the offense succeeds in gaining at least
yards
it gets a first down
meaning the team starts a new set of four downs to gain yet another
yards or to score
if the offense fails to gain a first down
yards
after
downs
the other team gets possession of the ball at the point where the fourth down ended
beginning with their first down to advance the ball in the opposite direction
except at the beginning of halves and after scores
the ball is always put into play by a snap
offensive players line up facing defensive players at the line of scrimmage
the position on the field where the play begins
one offensive player
the center
then passes
or
snaps
the ball backwards between his legs to a teammate behind him
usually the quarterback
players can then advance the ball in two ways
by running with the ball
also known as rushing
by throwing the ball to a teammate
known as a pass or as passing the football
if the pass is thrown down
field
it is known as a forward pass
the forward pass is a key factor distinguishing american and canadian football from other football sports
the offense can throw the ball forward only once during a down and only from behind the line of scrimmage
however
the ball can be handed
off to another player or thrown
pitched
or tossed sideways or backwards
a lateral pass
at any time
a down ends
and the ball becomes dead
after any of the following
the player with the ball is forced to the ground
a tackle
or has his forward progress halted by members of the other team
as determined by an official
a forward pass flies beyond the dimensions of the field
out of bounds
or touches the ground before it is caught
this is known as an incomplete pass
the ball is returned to the most recent line of scrimmage for the next down
the ball or the player with the ball goes out of bounds
a team scores
officials blow a whistle to notify players that the down is over
before each down
each team chooses a play
or coordinated movements and actions
that the players should follow on a down
sometimes
downs themselves are referred to as
plays
change of possession
the offense maintains possession of the ball unless one of the following things occurs
the team fails to get a first down
in four downs they fail to move the ball past a line
yards ahead of where they got their last first down
the defensive team takes over the ball at the spot where the
th
down play ends
a change of possession in this manner is commonly called a turnover on downs
the offense scores a touchdown or field goal
the team that scored then kicks the ball to the other team in a special play called a kickoff
the offense punts the ball to the defense
a punt is a kick in which a player drops the ball and kicks it before it hits the ground
punts are nearly always made on fourth down
when the offensive team does not want to risk giving up the ball to the other team at its current spot on the field
through a failed attempt to make a first down
and feels it is too far from the other team
s goal posts to attempt a field goal
a defensive player catches a forward pass
this is called an interception
and the player who makes the interception can run with the ball until he is tackled
forced out of bounds
or scores
an offensive player drops the ball
a fumble
and a defensive player picks it up
as with interceptions
a player recovering a fumble can run with the ball until tackled
forced out of bounds
or scores
backward passes that are not caught do not cause the down to end like incomplete forward passes do
instead the ball is still live as if it had been fumbled
lost fumbles and interceptions are together known as turnovers
the offensive team misses a field goal attempt
the defensive team gets the ball at the spot where the previous play began
or
in the nfl
at the spot of the kick
if the unsuccessful kick was attempted from within
yards
of the end zone
the other team gets the ball at its own
yard line
that is
yards from the end zone
if a field goal is missed or blocked and the ball remains in the field of play
a defensive player may pick up the ball and attempt to advance it
while in his own end zone
an offensive ball carrier is tackled
forced out of bounds
loses the ball out of bounds
or the offense commits certain fouls
this fairly rare occurrence is called a safety
an offensive ball carrier fumbles the ball forward into the opposing end zone
and then the ball goes out of bounds
this extremely rare occurrence leads to a touchback
with the ball going over to the opposing team at their
yard line
note that touchbacks during non
offensive special teams plays
such as punts and kickoffs
are quite common
scoring
a team scores points by the following plays
a touchdown
td
is worth
points
it is scored when a player runs the ball into or catches a pass in his opponent
s end zone
a touchdown is analogous to a try in rugby
unlike rugby
a player does not have to touch the ball to the ground to score
a touchdown is scored any time a player has possession of the ball while the ball is on or beyond the opponents
goal line
or the plane above it
o after a touchdown
the scoring team attempts a try
which is also analogous to the conversion in rugby
the ball is placed at the other team
yard
line
the
yard
line in the nfl
the team can attempt to kick it over the crossbar and through the goal posts in the manner of a field goal for
point
an extra point or point
after touchdown
pat
or run or pass it into the end zone in the manner of a touchdown for
points
a two
point conversion
in college football
if the defense intercepts or recovers a fumble during a one or two point conversion attempt and returns it to the opposing end zone
the defensive team is awarded the two points
a field goal
fg
is worth
points
and it is scored by kicking the ball over the crossbar and through the goal posts
uprights
field goals may be placekicked
kicked when the ball is held vertically against the ground by a teammate
or drop
kicked
extremely uncommon in the modern game
with only two successes in sixty
plus years in the nfl
a field goal is usually attempted on fourth down instead of a punt when the ball is close to the opponent
s goal line
or
when there is little or no time left to otherwise score
a safety
worth
points
is scored by the opposing team when the team in possession at the end of a down is responsible for the ball becoming dead behind its own goal line
for instance
a safety is scored by the defense if an offensive player is tackled
goes out of bounds
or fumbles the ball out of bounds in his own end zone
safeties are relatively rare
note that
though even more rare
the team initially on offense during a down can score a safety if a player of the original defense gains possession of the ball in front of his own goal line and then carries the ball or fumbles it into his own end zone where it becomes dead
however
if the ball becomes dead behind the goal line of the team in possession and its opponent is responsible for the ball being there
for instance
if the defense intercepts a forward pass in its own end zone and the ball becomes dead before the ball is advanced out of the end zone
it is a touchback
no points are scored and the team last in possession keeps possession with a first down at its own
yard line
in amateur football
in the extremely rare instance that a safety is scored on a try
it is worth only
point
kickoffs and free kicks
each half begins with a kickoff
teams also kick off after scoring touchdowns and field goals
the ball is kicked using a kicking tee from the team
s own
yard
line in the nfl and college football
as of the
season
the other team
s kick returner tries to catch the ball and advance it as far as possible
where he is stopped is the point where the offense will begin its drive
or series of offensive plays
if the kick returner catches the ball in his own end zone
he can either run with the ball
or elect for a touchback by kneeling in the end zone
in which case the receiving team then starts its offensive drive from its own
yard line
a touchback also occurs when the kick goes out
of
bounds in the end zone
a kickoff that goes out
of
bounds anywhere other than the end zone before being touched by the receiving team is a foul
and the ball will be placed where it went out of bounds or
yards
from the kickoff spot
depending on which is more advantageous to the opposite team
unlike with punts
once a kickoff goes
yards and the ball has hit the ground
it can be recovered by the kicking team
a team
especially one who is losing
can try to take advantage of this by attempting an onside kick
punts and turnovers in the end zone can also end in a touchback
after safeties
the team that gave up the points must free kick the ball to the other team from its own
yard line
penalties

main article
penalty
american football
fouls
a type of rule violation
are punished with penalties against the offending team
most penalties result in moving the football towards the offending team
s end zone
if the penalty would move the ball more than half the distance towards the offender
s end zone
the penalty becomes half the distance to the goal instead of its normal value
most penalties result in replaying the down
some defensive penalties give the offense an automatic first down
conversely
some offensive penalties result in loss of a down
loss of the right to repeat the down
if a penalty gives the offensive team enough yardage to gain a first down
they get a first down
as usual
if a foul occurs during a down
an official throws a yellow penalty flag near the spot of the foul
when the down ends
the team that did not commit the foul has the option of accepting the penalty
or declining the penalty and accepting the result of the down

most football players have highly specialized roles
at the college and nfl levels
most play only offense or only defense
offense
the offensive line
ol
consists of five players whose job is to protect the passer and clear the way for runners by blocking members of the defense
the lineman in the middle is the center
outside the center are the guards
and outside them are the tackles
except for the center
who snaps the ball to one of the backs
offensive linemen generally do not handle the ball
the quarterback
qb
receives the snap from the center on most plays
he then hands or tosses it to a running back
throws it to a receiver or runs with it himself
the quarterback is the leader of the offense and calls the plays that are signaled to him from the sidelines
running backs
rb
line up behind or beside the qb and specialize in running with the ball
they also block
catch passes and
on rare occasions
pass the ball to others or even receive the snap

tight ends
te
line up outside the offensive line
they can either play like wide receivers
catch passes
or like offensive linemen
protect the qb or create spaces for runners
sometimes an offensive lineman takes the tight end position and is referred to as a tackle eligible
at least seven players must line up on the line of scrimmage on every offensive play
the other players may line up anywhere behind the line
the exact number of running backs
wide receivers and tight ends may differ on any given play
for example
if the team needs only
yard
it may use three tight ends
two running backs and no wide receivers
on the other hand
if it needs
yards
it may replace all of its running backs and tight ends with wide receivers
defense
in contrast to members of the offense
the rules of professional football
nfl rulebook
and american college football
ncaa rulebook
do not specify starting position
movement
or coverage zones for members of the defensive team
except that they must be in the defensive zone at the start of play
the positions
movements and responsibilities of all defensive players are assigned by the team by selection of certain coverages
or patterns of placement and assignment of responsibilities
the positional roles are customary
these roles have varied over the history of american football
the following are customary defensive positions used in many coverages in modern american football
the defensive line consists of three to six players who line up immediately across from the offensive line
they try to occupy the offensive linemen in order to free up the linebackers
disrupt the backfield
behind the offensive line
of the offense
and tackle the running back if he has the ball before he can gain yardage or the quarterback before he can throw or pass the ball
they are the first line of defense
behind the defensive line are the linebackers
they line up between the defensive line and defensive backs and may either rush the quarterback or cover potential receivers
the last line of defense is known as the secondary
comprising at least three players who line up as defensive backs
who are either cornerbacks or positionsafeties
they cover the receivers and try to stop pass completions
they occasionally rush the quarterback
special teams
the units of players who handle kicking plays are known as special teams
three important special
teams players are the punter
who handles punts
the placekicker or kicker
who kicks off and attempts field goals and extra points
and the long snapper
who snaps the ball for extra points
field goals
and punts
also included on special teams are the returners
these players return punts or kickoffs and try to get in good field position
these players can also score touchdowns
uniform numbering
quarterback shaun carney has uniform number
in the nfl
ranges of uniform numbers are
usually
reserved for certain positions
quarterbacks
kickers
and punters
running backs
fullbacks
and defensive backs
centers
offensive lineman
wide receivers
tight ends
defensive linemen
linebackers
ncaa and high school rules specify only that offensive linemen must have numbers in the
range
but the ncaa
strongly recommends
that quarterbacks and running backs have numbers below
and wide receivers numbers above
this helps officials
as it means that numbers
to
are ineligible receivers
or players that may never receive a forward pass
there are no numbering restrictions on defensive players in the ncaa
other than that a team may not have two players on the field at the same time with the same jersey number
basic strategy
main article
american football strategy
because the game stops after every down
giving teams a chance to call a new play
strategy plays a major role in football
each team has a playbook of dozens to hundreds of plays
ideally
each play is a scripted
strategically sound team
coordinated endeavor
some plays are very safe
they are likely to get only a few yards
other plays have the potential for long gains but at a greater risk of a loss of yardage or a turnover
generally speaking
rushing plays are less risky than passing plays
however
there are relatively safe passing plays and risky running plays
to deceive the other team
some passing plays are designed to resemble running plays and vice versa
these are referred to as play
action passes and draws
respectively
there are many trick or gadget plays
such as when a team lines up as if it intends to punt and then tries to run or pass for a first down
such high
risk plays are a great thrill to the fans when they work
however
they can spell disaster if the opposing team realizes the deception and acts accordingly
the defense also plans plays in response to expectations of what the offense will do
for example
blitz
using linebackers or defensive backs to charge the quarterback
is often attempted when the team on defense expects a pass
a blitz makes downfield passing more difficult but exposes the defense to big gains if the offensive line stems the rush
many hours of preparation and strategizing
including film review by both players and coaches
go into the days between football games
this
along with the demanding physicality of football
see below
is why teams typically play at most one game per week
physicality
main articles
health issues in american football and american football protective equipment
a halfback leads fellow backs through an agility drill at the air force academy
american football is a collision sport
to stop the offense from advancing the ball
the defense must tackle the player with the ball by knocking or pulling him down
as such
defensive players must use some form of physical contact to bring the ball
carrier to the ground
within certain rules and guidelines
tacklers cannot kick or punch the runner
they also cannot grab the face mask of the runner
s helmet or lead into a tackle with their own helmet
despite these and other rules regarding unnecessary roughness
most other forms of tackling are legal
blockers and defenders trying to evade them also have wide leeway in trying to force their opponents out of the way
quarterbacks are regularly hit by defenders coming on full speed from outside the quarterback
s field of vision
this is commonly known as a blindside
to compensate for this
players must wear special protective equipment
such as a padded plastic helmet
shoulder pads
hip pads and knee pads
these protective pads were introduced decades ago and have improved ever since to help minimize lasting injury to players
an unintended consequence of all the safety equipment has resulted in increasing levels of violence in the game
players may now hurl themselves at one another at high speeds without a significant chance of injury
the injuries that do result tend to be severe and often season or career
ending and sometimes fatal
in previous years with less padding
tackling more closely resembled tackles in rugby football
better helmets have allowed players to use their helmets as weapons
this form of tackling is particularly unwise
because of the great potential for brain or spinal injury
all this has caused the various leagues
especially the nfl
to implement a complicated series of penalties for various types of contact
most recently
virtually any contact with the helmet of a defensive player on the quarterback
or any contact to the quarterback
s head
is now a foul
during the late
the penalty in high school football for spearing included ejection from the game
despite protective equipment and rule changes to emphasize safety
injuries remain very common in football
it is increasingly rare
for example
for nfl quarterbacks or running backs
who take the most direct hits
to make it through an entire season without missing some time to injury
additionally
football players died from direct football injuries in the years
and an additional
died indirectly from dehydration or other examples of
non
physical
dangers
according to the national center for catastrophic sport injury research
concussions are common
with about
suffered every year among high school players according to the brain injury association of arizona
in
president ronald reagan
who played football in high school
commented on the contact of the sport
football is the last thing left in civilization where men can literally fling themselves bodily at one another in combat and not be at war
extra and optional equipment such as neck rolls
spider pads
rib protectors
referred to as
flak jackets
and elbow pads help against injury as well
though they do not tend to be used by the majority of players due to their lack of requirement
the danger of football and the equipment required to reduce it make regulation football impractical for casual play
flag football and touch football are less violent variants of the game popular among recreational players
nutrition and dehydration
football players typically begin their season while the weather is still extremely warm and with the dangerous combination of warm weather and high humidity
dehydration is a great risk for the players
the players are usually required to follow a hydration schedule
it is extremely important for players to drink enough fluids because dehydration can seriously reduce athletic performance and increase the risk of heat illnesses
most trainers and coaches make it imperative for their players to drink fluids before they are thirsty
brain injury
the concussions committee of the nfl
co
chaired by dr
ira casson
has generally denied that concussions result in permanent brain injury
however
there is some research
reported in
which
using phone interviews based on the national health interview survey
showed increased incidence of diagnosis of memory loss and dementia among retired professional football players
such symptoms are believed related to the effects of concussion
more rigorous research is being conducted by dr
casson
neurologist
for the nfl
this finding is considered significant as such injuries may potentially affect high school and college players also

history of tennis
most historians believe that tennis originated in france in the
th century
but the ball was then struck with the palm of the hand
it was not until the sixteenth century that rackets came into use
and the game began to be called
tennis
it was popular in england and france
although the game was only played indoors where the ball could be hit off the wall
henry viii of england was a big fan of this game
which historians now refer to as real tennis
harry gem and his friend augurio perera developed a game that combined elements of rackets and the basque ball game pelota
which they played on perera

major walter clopton wingfield designed and patented a similar game
which he called sphairistike
greek
from ancient greek meaning
skill at playing at ball
and was soon known simply as
sticky
for the amusement of his guests at a garden party on his estate of nantclwyd
in llanelidan
wales
he likely based his game on the evolving sport of outdoor tennis including real tennis
according to some tennis historians
modern tennis terminology also derives from this period
as wingfield borrowed both the name and much of the french vocabulary of real tennis and applied them to his new game

equipment
main article
tennis technology
part of the appeal of tennis stems from the simplicity of equipment required for play
beginners need only a racquet and balls
edit
racquets
the tennis racquet comprises a handle and neck joining a roughly circular frame that holds an array of tightly pulled strings
for the first century of the modern game
racquets were of wood and of standard size
and strings were of animal gut
laminated wood construction yielded more strength in racquets used through most of the
th century until first metal and then composites of carbon graphite
ceramics
and lighter metals such as titanium were introduced
these stronger materials enabled the production of oversized rackets that yielded yet more power
meanwhile technology led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel of gut yet with added durability
edit
balls
main article
tennis ball
tennis balls are of hollow rubber with a felt coating
traditionally white
the predominant color was gradually changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the twentieth century to allow for improved visibility
edit
miscellaneous
advanced players improve their performance through a number of accoutrements
vibration dampers may be interlaced in the proximal part of the string array for improved feel
racket handles may be customized with absorbent materials to improve the players
grip
players often use sweat bands on their wrists to keep their hands dry as well
finally
although the game can be played in a variety of shoes
specialized tennis shoes have wide
flat soles for stability and a built
up front structure to avoid excess wear

tennis court
the dimensions of a tennis court
tennis is played on a rectangular
flat surface
usually grass
clay
a hardcourt of concrete and
or asphalt and occasionally carpet
indoor
the court is
feet
long
and
feet
wide for singles matches and
ft
for doubles matches
additional clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls
a net is stretched across the full width of the court
parallel with the baselines
dividing it into two equal ends
the net is
feet
inches
high at the posts and
feet
cm
high in the center
the modern tennis court owes its design to major walter clopton wingfield who
in
patented a court much the same as the current one for his stick
tennis
sphairistike
this template was modified in
to the court design that exists today
with markings similar to wingfield
s version
but with the hourglass shape of his court changed to a rectangle
edit
lines
the lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline
farthest back
and the service line
middle of the court
the short mark in the center of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark
the outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines
these are the boundaries used when doubles is being played
the lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines and are used as boundaries in singles play
the area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley
which is considered playable in doubles play
the line that runs across the center of a player
s side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side
despite its name
this is not where a player legally stands when making a serve
the line dividing the service line in two is called the center line or center service line
the boxes this center line creates are called the service boxes
depending on a player
s position
he or she will have to hit the ball into one of these when serving
a ball is out only if none of it has hit the line or the area inside the lines upon its first bounce
all the lines are required to be between
and
inches
mm
in width
the baseline can be up to
inches
mm
wide if so desired

play of a single point
main article
point
tennis
two players before a serve
the players
or teams
start on opposite sides of the net
one player is designated the server
and the opposing player is the receiver
service alternates game by game between the two players
or teams
for each point
the server starts behind his baseline
between the center mark and the sideline
the receiver may start anywhere on their side of the net
when the receiver is ready
the server will serve
although the receiver must play to the pace of the server
in a legal service
the ball travels past the net
without touching it
and into the diagonally opposite service box
if the ball hits the net but lands in the service box
this is a let or net service
which is void
and the server gets to retake that serve
the player can serve any number of let services in a point and they are always treated as voids and not as faults
a fault is a serve that falls long or wide of the service box
or does not clear the net
there is also a
foot fault
which occurs when a player
s foot touches the baseline or an extension of the center mark before the ball is hit
if the second service is also faulty
this is a double fault
and the receiver wins the point
however
if the serve is in
it is considered a legal service
a legal service starts a rally
in which the players alternate hitting the ball across the net
a legal return consists of the player or team hitting the ball exactly once before it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net
provided that it still falls in the server
s court
the ball then travels back past the net and bounces in the court on the opposite side
the first player or team to fail to make a legal return loses the point

scoring
main article
tennis score
a tennis match is determined through the best of
or
sets
typically for both men
s and women
s matches
the first player to win two sets wins the match
at certain important tennis tournaments for men
including all four grand slam tournaments and the final of the olympic games
the first player to win three sets wins the match
a set consists of games
and games
in turn
consist of points
a game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving
a game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent
the running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis
scores from zero to three points are described as
love
fifteen
thirty
and
forty
respectively
see the main article tennis score for the origin of these words as used in tennis
if at least three points have been scored by each player
and the scores are equal
the score is
deuce
if at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent
the score of the game is
advantage
for the player in the lead
during informal games
advantage
can also be called
ad in
or
ad out
depending on whether the serving player or receiving player is ahead
respectively
in tournament play
the chair umpire calls the point count
fifteen
love
after each point
the score of a tennis match during play is always read with the serving player
s score first
after a match
the score is always read with the winning player
s score first
at the end of a game
the chair umpire also announces the winner of the game and the overall score
a game point occurs in tennis whenever the player who is in the lead in the game needs only one more point to win the game
the terminology is extended to sets
set point
matches
match point
and even championships
championship point
for example
if the player who is serving has a score of
love
the player has a triple game point
triple set point
etc
as the player has three consecutive chances to win the game
game points
set points
and match points are not part of official scoring and are not announced by the chair umpire in tournament play
a break point occurs if the receiver
not the server
has a chance to win the game in the next rally
break points are of particular importance because serving is generally advantageous
a receiver who has two
score of
or three
score of love
consecutive chances to win the game has double break point or triple break point
respectively
if the receiver does
in fact
win their break point
the receiver is said to have converted their break point
but if the receiver fails to win their break point it is called a failure to convert
a set consists of a sequence of games played with service alternating between games
ending when the count of games won meets certain criteria
typically
a player wins a set by winning at least six games and at least two games more than the opponent
if one player has won six games and the opponent five
an additional game is played
if the leading player wins that game
the player wins the set
if the trailing player wins the game
a tie
break is played
a tie
break
played under a separate set of rules
allows one player to win one more game and thus the set
to give a final set score of
only in the final sets of matches at the australian open
the french open
wimbledon
the olympic games
davis cup
and fed cup are tie
breaks not played
in these cases
sets are played indefinitely until one player has a two
game lead
love
set means that the loser of the set won zero games
in tournament play
the chair umpire announces the winner of the set and the overall score

another
however informal
tennis format is called canadian doubles
this involves three players
with one person playing a doubles team
the single player gets to utilize the alleys normally reserved only for a doubles team
conversely
the doubles team does not use the alleys when executing a shot
the scoring is the same as a regular game
this format is not sanctioned by any official body
australian doubles
another informal and unsanctioned form of tennis
is played with similar rules to the
kiwi
style
only in this version
players rotate court position after each game
as such
each player plays doubles and singles over the course of a match
with the singles player always serving
scoring styles vary
but one popular method is to assign a value of
points to each game
with the server taking both points if he or she holds serve and the doubles team each taking one if they break serve
wheelchair tennis can be played by able
bodied players as well as people who require a wheelchair for mobility
an extra bounce is permitted
this rule makes it possible to have mixed wheelchair and able

who sits in a raised chair to one side of the court
the umpire has absolute authority to make factual determinations
the umpire may be assisted by line judges
who determine whether the ball has landed within the required part of the court and who also call foot faults
there also may be a net judge who determines whether the ball has touched the net during service
in some tournaments
certain line judges
usually those who would be calling the serve
are replaced by electronic sensors that beep when an out call would have been made
in some tournaments
electric line calls aren
t made
but rather are used to assist the linespeople
when a ball lands in a spot where the linesperson isn
t sure if the ball was in or out
a noise is made that only linespeople can hear
because they are wearing headsets
and helps them to make the call
in some open
tournament matches
players are allowed to challenge a limited number of close calls by means of electronic review

a call may be questioned by reference to the mark left by the ball

who is usually located off the court
is the final authority about tennis rules
when called to the court by a player or team captain
the referee may overrule the umpire
s decision if the tennis rules were violated
question of law
but may not change the umpire
s decision on a question of fact
if
however
the referee is on the court during play
the referee may overrule the umpire
s decision
ball boys and girls may be employed to retrieve balls
pass them to the players
and hand players their towels
they have no adjudicative role
in rare events
if they are hurt or if they have caused a hindrance
the umpire may ask them for a statement of what actually happened
the umpire may consider their statements when making a decision
in some leagues
especially junior leagues
players make their own calls
trusting each other to be honest
this is the case for many school and university level matches
the referee or referee
s assistant
however
can be called on court at a player
s request
and the referee or assistant may change a player
s call
in unofficiated matches
a ball is out only if the player entitled to make the call is sure that the ball is out

juniors
main article
junior tennis
in tennis
a junior is a player
and under who is still legally protected by a parent or guardian
players on the main adult tour who are under
must have documents signed by a parent or guardian
these players
however
are still eligible to play in junior tournaments
the international tennis federation
itf
conducts a junior tour that allows juniors to establish a world ranking and an association of tennis professionals
atp
or women
s tennis association
wta
ranking
most juniors who enter the international circuit do so by progressing through itf
satellite
future
and challenger tournaments before entering the main circuit
the latter three circuits also have adults competing in them
some juniors
however
such as australian lleyton hewitt and frenchman ga
l monfils
have catapulted directly from the junior tour to the atp tour by dominating the junior scene or by taking advantage of opportunities given to them to participate in professional tournaments
in
the itf implemented a new rankings scheme to encourage greater participation in doubles
by combining two rankings
singles and doubles
into one combined tally
junior tournaments do not offer prize money except for the grand slam tournaments
which are the most prestigious junior events
juniors may earn income from tennis by participating in the future
satellite
or challenger tours
tournaments are broken up into different tiers offering different amounts of ranking points
culminating with grade a
leading juniors are allowed to participate for their nation in the junior fed cup and davis cup competitions as well
to succeed in tennis often means having to begin playing at a young age
to facilitate and nurture a junior
s growth in tennis
almost all tennis playing nations have developed a junior development system
juniors develop their play through a range of tournaments on all surfaces
accommodating all different standards of play
talented juniors may also receive sponsorships from governing bodies or private institutions

match play
convention dictates that two players shake hands at the end of a match
a tennis match is intended to be continuous
because stamina is a relevant factor
arbitrary delays are not permitted
in most cases
service is required to occur no more than
seconds after the end of the previous point
this is increased to
seconds when the players change ends
after every odd
numbered game
and a
second break is permitted between sets
other than this
breaks are permitted only when forced by events beyond the players
control
such as rain
damaged footwear
damaged racquet
or the need to retrieve an errant ball
should a player be determined to be stalling repeatedly
the chair umpire may initially give a warning followed by subsequent penalties of
point
game
and default of the match for the player who is consistently taking longer than the allowed time limit
in the event of a rain delay
darkness or other external conditions halting play
the match is resumed at a later time
with the same score as at the time of the delay
and the players at the same end of the court when rain halted play
or at the same position
north or south
if play is resumed on a different court
balls wear out quickly in serious play and
therefore
in atp and wta tournaments
they are changed after every nine games with the first change occurring after only seven games
because the first set of balls is also used for the pre
match warm
up
as a courtesy to the receiver
the server will often signal to the receiver before the first serve of the game in which new balls are used as a reminder that they are using new balls
however
in itf tournaments like fed cup
the balls are changed in a
style
continuity of the balls
condition is considered part of the game
so if a re
warm
up is required after an extended break in play
usually due to rain
then the re
warm
up is done using a separate set of balls
and use of the match balls is resumed only when play resumes
a recent proposed rules change is to allow coaching on court during a match on a limited basis
this has been instituted in women
s tennis for wta tour events from
onwards

a serve
or
more formally
service
in tennis is a shot to start a point
the serve is initiated by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it
usually near the apex of its trajectory
into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net
the serve may be hit under
or overhand
experienced players strive to master the conventional overhand serve to maximize its power and placement
the server may employ different types of serve including flat serve
topspin serve
slice serve
and kick
american twist

a reverse type of spin serve is hit in a manner that spins the ball opposite the natural spin of the server
the spin direction depending upon right
or left
handedness
if the ball is spinning counterclockwise
it will curve right from the hitter
s point of view and curve left if spinning clockwise
some servers are content to use the serve simply to initiate the point
however
advanced players often try to hit a winning shot with their serve
a winning serve that is not touched by the opponent is called an
ace

the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of the body
continues across the body as contact is made with the ball
and ends on the left side of the body
there are various grips for executing the forehand
and their popularity has fluctuated over the years
the most important ones are the continental

the western forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players
no matter which grip is used
most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racquet
but there have been fine players with two
handed forehands
in the
s and
the ecuadorian
american player pancho segura used a two
handed forehand to achieve a devastating effect against larger

for right
handed players
the backhand is a stroke that begins on the left side of their body
continues across their body as contact is made with the ball
and ends on the right side of their body
it can be executed with either one hand or with both and is generally considered more difficult to master than the forehand
for most of the
th century
the backhand was performed with one hand
using either an eastern or a continental grip
the first notable players to use two hands were the
s australians vivian mcgrath and john bromwich
but they were lonely exceptions
the two
handed grip gained popularity in the
s as bj
rn borg
chris evert
jimmy connors
and later mats wilander and andre agassi used it to great effect
and it is now used by a large number of the world
s best players
including rafael nadal and serena williams
two hands give the player more control
while one hand can generate a slice shot
applying backspin on the ball to produce a low trajectory bounce
reach is also limited with the two
handed shot
the player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time
don budge
had a powerful one
handed stroke in the
s and
s that imparted topspin onto the ball

the half volley is made by hitting the ball on the rise just after it has bounced
once again generally in the vicinity of the net
the swinging volley is hit out of the air as the player approaches the net
it is an offensive shot used to take preparation time away from the opponent
from a poor defensive position on the baseline
the lob can be used as either an offensive or defensive weapon
hitting the ball high and deep into the opponent
s court to either enable the lobber to get into better defensive position or to win the point outright by hitting it over the opponent
s head
if the lob is not hit deeply enough into the other court

the opponent may then hit an overhead smash
a hard

if an opponent is deep in his court
a player may suddenly employ an unexpected drop shot
softly tapping the ball just over the net so that the opponent is unable to run in fast enough to retrieve it

from
tilden won singles titles at wimbledon three times and the u

donald budge became the first person to win all four grand slam singles titles during the same calendar year and won six consecutive grand slam singles titles in

tilden called budge
the finest player
days a year that ever lived
and in his
autobiography
jack kramer said that
based on consistent play
budge was the greatest player ever
some observers
however
also felt that kramer deserved consideration for the title
kramer was among the few who dominated amateur and professional tennis during the late
s and early
tony trabert has said that of the players he saw before the start of the open era
kramer was the best male champion
by the latter half of the
s and
budge and others had added pancho gonzales and lew hoad to the list of contenders
budge reportedly believed that gonzales was the greatest player ever
gonzales said about hoad
when lew
s game was at its peak nobody could touch him
i think his game was the best game ever
better than mine
he was capable of making more shots than anybody
his two volleys were great
his overhead was enormous
he had the most natural tennis mind with the most natural tennis physique
during the open era
first rod laver and then more recently bj
rn borg and pete sampras were regarded by many of their contemporaries as among the greatest ever
andre agassi
the only male player in history to have achieved a career golden slam in singles tennis
has been called the best service returner in the history of the game and is regarded by a number of critics and fellow players to be among the greatest players of all time
roger federer is now considered by many observers to have the most

history of golf
the origin of golf is unclear and open to debate
some historians trace the sport back to the roman game of paganica
in which participants used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball
one theory asserts that paganica spread throughout europe as the romans conquered most of the continent
during the first century b
and eventually evolved into the modern game
others cite chuiwan
chui
means striking and
wan
means small ball
as the progenitor
a chinese game played between the eighth and
th centuries
a ming dynasty scroll dating back to
entitled
the autumn banquet
shows a member of the chinese imperial court swinging what appears to be a golf club at a small ball with the aim of sinking it into a hole
the game is thought to have been introduced into europe during the middle ages
another early game that resembled modern golf was known as cambuca in england and chambot in france
this game was
in turn
exported to the low countries
germany
and england
where it was called pall
mall
pronounced
pell mell
some observers
however
believe that golf descended from the persian game
chaug
in addition
kolven
a game involving a ball and curved bats
was played annually in loenen
netherlands
beginning in
to commemorate the capture of the assassin of floris v
a year earlier
according to the most widely accepted account
however
the modern game originated in scotland around the
th century
with shepherds knocking stones into rabbit holes on the current site of the old course at st andrews

a golf course consists of a series of holes
each with a teeing area that is set off by two markers showing the bounds of the legal tee area
fairway
rough and other hazards
and the putting green surrounded by the fringe with the pin

and cup
different levels of grass are varied to increase difficulty
or to allow for putting in the case of the green
while many holes are designed with a direct line
of
sight from the tee
off point to the green
some of the holes may bend
either to the left or to the right
this is called a

if the hole angles leftwards and vice versa
sometimes
a hole
s direction can bend twice and is called a
double dogleg
a typical golf course consists of
holes but nine hole courses are common and can be played twice through for
holes
early scottish golf courses were primarily laid out on links land
soil covered sand dunes directly inland from beaches
this gave rise to the term golf links
particularly applied to seaside courses and those built on naturally sandy soil inland

every round of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order
a round typically consists of
holes that are played in the order determined by the course layout

a standard round consists of two consecutive nine
hole rounds
playing a hole on a golf course is initiated by putting a ball into play by striking it with a club on the teeing area
also called the
tee box
or simply
the tee
when this initial stroke
or
shot
is required to be a long one due to the length of the hole
it is usual
but not required
for a golfer to suspend
or

the ball on a tee prior to striking it
tee
in this last sense is a small peg which can be used to elevate the ball slightly above the ground up to a few centimeters high
this elevation is at the discretion of the golfer
tee pegs are commonly made of wood but may be constructed of any material
the ball may even be
tee
on a mound of grass or dirt
at one time a small pile of sand placed by the golfer was routinely used and sand was provided at teeing areas for golfers

when the initial shot on a hole is a long
distance shot intended to move the ball a great distance down the fairway
this shot is commonly called a
drive

commonly called
sinking the putt
the goal of getting the ball into the hole
holing
the ball
in as few strokes as possible may be impeded by obstacles such as areas of long grass called rough
usually found alongside fairways
which both impedes advancement and makes it harder to advance the golf ball
bunkers
sand traps
and water hazards
in most forms of gameplay
each player plays his or her ball until it is holed
players can walk or drive in motorized carts over the course
play can be done either singly or in groups and sometimes accompanied by caddies
who carry and manage the players

rules and regulations
main article
rules of golf
the rules of golf are internationally standardised and are jointly governed by the r
spun off in
from the royal and ancient golf club of st andrews
founded
and the united states golf association
usga
the underlying principle of the rules is fairness
as stated on the back cover of the official rule book
play the ball as it lies
play the course as you find it
and if you cannot do either
do what is fair
there are strict regulations regarding the amateur status of golfers
essentially
anybody who has ever received payment or compensation for giving instruction
or played golf for money
is not considered an amateur and may not participate in competitions limited solely to amateurs
however
amateur golfers may receive expenses which comply with strict guidelines and they may accept non
cash prizes within the limits established by the rules of amateur status
in addition to the officially printed rules
golfers also abide by a set of guidelines called golf etiquette
etiquette guidelines cover matters such as safety
fairness
pace of play
and a player
s obligation to contribute to the care of the course
though there are no penalties for breach of etiquette rules
players generally follow the rules of golf etiquette in an effort to improve everyone
s playing experience
edit
penalties
penalties are incurred in certain situations
they are counted towards a player
s score as if there were extra swing
at the ball
strokes are added for rule infractions or for hitting one
s ball into an unplayable situation
a lost ball or a ball hit out of bounds result in a penalty of one stroke and distance
rule
a one stroke penalty is assessed if a player
s equipment causes the ball to move or the removal of a loose impediment causes the ball to move
rule
if a golfer makes a stroke at the wrong ball
rule
or hits a fellow golfer
s ball with a putt
rule
the player incurs a two stroke penalty
most rule infractions lead to stroke penalties but also can lead to disqualification
disqualification could be from cheating
signing for a lower score
or from rule infractions that lead to improper play

golf equipment
golf clubs are used to hit a golf ball
each club is composed of a shaft with a lance
grip
on the top end and a club head on the bottom
long
clubs
which have a lower amount of degreed loft
are those meant to propel the ball a comparatively longer distance and
short
clubs
a higher degree
a comparatively short distance
typically
the actual physical length of each club is longer or shorter
depending on the distance the club is intended to propel the ball
the
driver
is the largest
headed and
longest
club
woods are slightly shorter but still comparatively large
headed clubs
used for long
distance fairway shots
woods are now typically made of metal
the traditional name
woods
remains in general use but is gradually being replaced by the term
fairway metal
next shorter in length are the irons
the most numerous and versatile class used for a wide variety of shots
hybrid
golf
clubs which embody characteristics of both woods and irons in varying degrees
are increasingly being used in preference to long irons in many places because they are easier for the average golfer to use
last but not least
putters are used to roll the ball across the green into the cup
a maximum of
clubs is allowed in a player
s bag at one time during a stipulated round
the choice of clubs is at the golfer
s discretion
although every club must be constructed in accordance with parameters outlined in the rules
clubs which meet these parameters are commonly called
conforming
violation of these rules can result in disqualification
the exact shot hit at any given time on a golf course
and which club is used to accomplish the shot
are always completely at the discretion of the golfer
in other words
there is no restriction whatsoever on which club a golfer may or may not use at any time for any shot
golf balls are spherical
usually white
although other colours are allowed
and minutely pock
marked by
dimples
that decrease aerodynamic drag by decreasing air turbulence around the ball in motion
thereby allowing the ball to fly farther
a tee is allowed only for the first stroke on each hole
unless the player must hit a provisional or replay his or her first shot from the tee
many golfers wear golf shoes with metal or plastic spikes designed to increase traction
thus allowing for longer and more accurate shots
a golf bag is used to transport golf clubs
golf bags have several pockets designed for carrying equipment and supplies such as tees
balls
and gloves
golf bags can be carried
pulled on a two
wheel pull cart or harnessed to a motorized golf cart during play
golf bags have both a hand strap and shoulder strap for carrying
and sometimes have retractable legs that allow the bag to stand upright when at rest

stroke mechanics
main article
golf stroke mechanics
golfers start with the non
dominant side of the body facing the target
at address the body and club are positioned parallel to the target line
the feet are commonly shoulder width apart for middle irons and putters
narrower for short irons and wider for long irons and woods
the ball is positioned in the center of the players stance for short irons and putters
more to the front for middle irons and even more for long irons and woods
the golfer chooses a grip
the golfer chooses a golf club and stroke appropriate to the distance
the drive is used on the tee box to tee off long distances
the approach is used in long to mid distance shots
the chip is used for relatively short distance shots around the green
the goal of the chip is to land the ball safely on the green allowing it to roll out towards the hole
the putt is used in short distance shots on or near the green
the goal of the putt is to get the ball in the hole or as close to the hole as possible

scoring and handicapping
edit
par
main article
par
score
a hole is classified by its par
the number of strokes a skilled golfer should require to complete play of the hole
for example
a skilled golfer expects to reach the green on a par
four hole in two strokes
this would be considered a green in regulation or gir
one from the tee
the
drive
and another
second
stroke to the green
the
approach
and then roll the ball into the hole in two putts for par
a golf hole is either a par
three
four or
five
rarely
six
very rarely
seven
the key factor for classifying the par of a hole is the distance from the tee to the green
a typical par
three hole is less than
yards
metres
in length
with a par
four hole ranging between
and
yards
metres
and a par
five hole being longer than
yards
metres
although uncommon
par
six and even par
seven holes do exist and can stretch well over
yards
metres
the gradient of the course
uphill or downhill
can also affect the par rating
if the tee
to
green distance on a hole is predominantly downhill
it will play shorter than its physical length and may be given a lower par rating
the opposite is true for uphill holes
par ratings are also affected by factors such as the placement of hazards or the shape of the green
which can sometimes affect the play of a hole by requiring an extra stroke to avoid playing into hazards
eighteen hole courses may have four par
three
ten par
four
and four par
five holes
though other combinations exist and are not less worthy than courses of par
many major championships are contested on courses playing to a par of

in some countries

basic forms of golf
edit
match play
in match play
two players
or two teams
play each hole as a separate contest against each other
the party with the lower score wins that hole
or if the scores of both players or teams are equal the hole is
halved
tied
the game is won by the party that wins more holes than the other
in the case that one team or player has taken a lead that cannot be overcome in the number of holes remaining to be played
the match is deemed to be won by the party in the lead
and the remainder of the holes are not played
for example
if one party already has a lead of six holes
and only five holes remain to be played on the course
the match is over
at any given point
if the lead is equal to the number of holes remaining
the match is said to be
dormie
and is continued until the leader increases the lead by one hole or ties any of the remaining holes
thereby winning the match
or until the match ends in a tie with the lead player
s opponent winning all remaining holes
when the game is tied after the predetermined number of holes have been played
it may be continued until one side takes a one
hole lead
edit
stroke play
in stroke play
the score achieved for each and every hole of the round or tournament is added to produce the total score
and the player with the lowest score wins
stroke play is the game most commonly played by professional golfers
if there is a tie after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament
a playoff takes place between all tied players
playoffs are either sudden death or employ a pre
determined number of holes
anywhere from three to a full eighteen
in sudden death
a player who scores lower on a hole than all of his opponents wins the match
if at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre
determined number of holes
then play continues in sudden death format
where the first player to win a hole wins the tournament
edit
other forms of golf
edit
skins
in a skins game
golfers compete on each hole
as a separate contest
played for prize money on the professional level or as a means of a wager for amateurs
a skin
or the prize money assigned to each hole
carries over to subsequent holes if the hole is tied
or halved
if you come to the end of the round and there are still skins left over
play continues until the final skin has been decided
edit
stableford
under the stableford system the player gains points for the score achieved on each hole of the round or tournament
point for a bogey
points for a par
points for a birdie
points for an eagle
the points achieved for each hole of the round or tournament are added together to produce the total points score
the player with the highest score wins
edit
team play
a foursome
defined in rule
is played between two teams of two players each
in which each team has only one ball and players alternate playing it
for example
if players a and b form a team
a tees off on the first hole
b will play the second shot
a the third
and so on until the hole is finished
on the second hole
b will tee off
regardless who played the last putt on the first hole
then a plays the second shot
and so on
foursomes can be played as match play or stroke play
a four
ball
rules
and
is also played between two teams of two players each
but every player plays his
her own ball and for each team
the lower score on each hole is counted
four
balls can be played as match play or stroke play
there are also popular unofficial variations on team play
in scramble
also known as ambrose or best shot
each player in a team tees off on each hole
and the players decide which shot was best
every player then plays his
her second shot from within a clublength of where the best shot has come to rest
and the procedure is repeated until the hole is finished
in a champagne scramble
each player in a team tees off on each hole
the best drive is used and all players play their own ball from this spot
in best ball
each player plays the hole as normal
but the lowest score of all the players on the team counts as the team
s score
in a greensome
also called modified alternate shot
both players tee off
and then pick the best shot as in a scramble
the player who did not shoot the best first shot plays the second shot
the play then alternates as in a foursome
a variant of greensome is sometimes played where the opposing team chooses which of their opponent
s tee shots the opponents should use
the player who did not shoot the chosen first shot plays the second shot
play then continues as a greensome
there is also a form of starting called shotgun
which is mainly used for tournament play
a shotgun start consists of groups starting on different holes
allowing for all players to start and end their round at the same time

handicap systems
main article
handicap
golf
a handicap is a numerical measure of an amateur golfer
s ability to play golf over the course of
holes
handicaps can be applied either for stroke play competition or match play competition
in either competition
a handicap generally represents the number of strokes above par that a player will achieve on an above average day
when playing well
in stroke play competition
the competitor
s handicap is subtracted from their total
gross
score at the end of the round
to calculate a
net
score against which standings are calculated
in match play competition
handicap strokes are assigned on a hole
by
hole basis
according to the handicap rating of each hole
which is provided by the course
the hardest holes on the course receive the most handicap strokes
with the easiest holes receiving the least handicap strokes
calculating a handicap is often complicated
but essentially it is representative of the average over par of a number of a player
s previous above average rounds
adjusted for course difficulty
legislation regarding the calculation of handicaps differs among countries
for example
handicap rules may include the difficulty of the course the golfer is playing on by taking into consideration factors such as the number of bunkers
the length of the course
the difficulty and slopes of the greens
the width of the fairways
and so on
handicap systems are not used in professional golf
professional golfers often score several strokes below par for a round and thus have a calculated handicap of
or less
meaning that their handicap results in the addition of strokes to their round score
someone with a handicap of zero or less is often referred to as a scratch golfer

professional golf tours
there are at least twenty professional golf tours

finding sponsors
and regulating the tour
typically a tour has
members
who are entitled to compete in most of its events
and also invites non
members to compete in some of them
gaining membership of an elite tour is highly competitive
and most professional golfers never achieve it
the most widely known tour is the pga tour
which tends to attract the strongest fields
outside the four majors and the four world golf championships events
this is due mostly to the fact that most pga tour events have a first prize of at least us
the pga european tour
which attracts a substantial number of top golfers from outside north america
ranks second to the pga tour in worldwide prestige

a computer is a programmable machine that receives input
stores and manipulates data
and provides output in a useful format
although mechanical examples of computers have existed through much of recorded human history
the first electronic computers were developed in the mid
th century
these were the size of a large room
consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers
pcs
modern computers based on integrated circuits are millions to billions of times more capable than the early machines
and occupy a fraction of the space
simple computers are small enough to fit into small pocket devices
and can be powered by a small battery
personal computers in their various forms are icons of the information age and are what most people think of as
computers
however
the embedded computers found in many devices from mp
players to fighter aircraft and from toys to industrial robots are the most numerous
the ability to store and execute lists of instructions called programs makes computers extremely versatile
distinguishing them from calculators
the church
turing thesis is a mathematical statement of this versatility
any computer with a certain minimum capability is
in principle
capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform
therefore computers ranging from a netbook to a supercomputer are all able to perform the same computational tasks
given enough time and storage capacity

history of computing hardware
the jacquard loom
on display at the museum of science and industry in manchester
england
was one of the first programmable devices
the first use of the word
computer
was recorded in
referring to a person who carried out calculations
or computations
and the word continued to be used in that sense until the middle of the
th century
from the end of the
th century onwards though
the word began to take on its more familiar meaning
describing a machine that carries out computations
the history of the modern computer begins with two separate technologies
automated calculation and programmability
but no single device can be identified as the earliest computer
partly because of the inconsistent application of that term
examples of early mechanical calculating devices include the abacus
the slide rule and arguably the astrolabe and the antikythera mechanism
which dates from about
bc
hero of alexandria
ad
built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting
minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums that might be considered to be a means of deciding which parts of the mechanism performed which actions and when
this is the essence of programmability
the
castle clock
an astronomical clock invented by al
jazari in
is considered to be the earliest programmable analog computer
it displayed the zodiac
the solar and lunar orbits
a crescent moon
shaped pointer travelling across a gateway causing automatic doors to open every hour
and five robotic musicians who played music when struck by levers operated by a camshaft attached to a water wheel
the length of day and night could be re
programmed to compensate for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year
the renaissance saw a re
invigoration of european mathematics and engineering
wilhelm schickard
device was the first of a number of mechanical calculators constructed by european engineers
but none fit the modern definition of a computer
because they could not be programmed
in
joseph marie jacquard made an improvement to the textile loom by introducing a series of punched paper cards as a template which allowed his loom to weave intricate patterns automatically
the resulting jacquard loom was an important step in the development of computers because the use of punched cards to define woven patterns can be viewed as an early
albeit limited
form of programmability
it was the fusion of automatic calculation with programmability that produced the first recognizable computers
in
charles babbage was the first to conceptualize and design a fully programmable mechanical computer
his analytical engine
limited finances and babbage
s inability to resist tinkering with the design meant that the device was never completed
in the late
herman hollerith invented the recording of data on a machine readable medium
prior uses of machine readable media
above
had been for control
not data
after some initial trials with paper tape
he settled on punched cards
to process these punched cards he invented the tabulator
and the keypunch machines
these three inventions were the foundation of the modern information processing industry
large
scale automated data processing of punched cards was performed for the
united states census by hollerith
s company
which later became the core of ibm
by the end of the
th century a number of technologies that would later prove useful in the realization of practical computers had begun to appear
the punched card
boolean algebra
the vacuum tube
thermionic valve
and the teleprinter
during the first half of the
th century
many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated analog computers
which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for computation
however
these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers
alan turing is widely regarded to be the father of modern computer science
in
turing provided an influential formalisation of the concept of the algorithm and computation with the turing machine
of his role in the modern computer
time magazine in naming turing one of the
most influential people of the
th century

the fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard
opening a spreadsheet or a word
processing program

which used vacuum tube based computation

and regenerative capacitor memory
the use of regenerative memory allowed it to be much more compact than its peers
being approximately the size of a large desk or workbench
since intermediate results could be stored and then fed back into the same set of computation elements

which had limited programmability but demonstrated that a device using thousands of tubes could be reasonably reliable and electronically reprogrammable
it was used for breaking german wartime codes

s ballistic research laboratory eniac
which used decimal arithmetic and is sometimes called the first general purpose electronic computer
since konrad zuse
s z
of
used electromagnets instead of electronics
initially
however
eniac had an inflexible architecture which essentially required rewiring to change its programming
several developers of eniac
recognizing its flaws
came up with a far more flexible and elegant design
which came to be known as the
stored program architecture
or von neumann architecture
this design was first formally described by john von neumann in the paper first draft of a report on the edvac
distributed in
a number of projects to develop computers based on the stored
program architecture commenced around this time
the first of these being completed in great britain
the first to be demonstrated working was the manchester small
scale experimental machine
ssem or
baby
while the edsac
completed a year after ssem
was the first practical implementation of the stored program design
shortly thereafter
the machine originally described by von neumann
s paper
edvac
was completed but did not see full
time use for an additional two years
nearly all modern computers implement some form of the stored
program architecture
making it the single trait by which the word
computer
is now defined
while the technologies used in computers have changed dramatically since the first electronic
general
purpose computers of the
most still use the von neumann architecture
beginning in the
soviet scientists sergei sobolev and nikolay brusentsov conducted research on ternary computers
devices that operated on a base three numbering system of
and
rather than the conventional binary numbering system upon which most computers are based
they designed the setun
a functional ternary computer
at moscow state university
the device was put into limited production in the soviet union
but supplanted by the more common binary architecture
computers using vacuum tubes as their electronic elements were in use throughout the
but by the
s had been largely replaced by transistor
based machines
which were smaller
faster
cheaper to produce
required less power
and were more reliable
the first transistorised computer was demonstrated at the university of manchester in
in the
integrated circuit technology and the subsequent creation of microprocessors
such as the intel
further decreased size and cost and further increased speed and reliability of computers
by the late
many products such as video recorders contained dedicated computers called microcontrollers
and they started to appear as a replacement to mechanical controls in domestic appliances such as washing machines
the
s witnessed home computers and the now ubiquitous personal computer
with the evolution of the internet
personal computers are becoming as common as the television and the telephone in the household

modern smartphones are fully programmable computers in their own right

stored program architecture
main articles
computer program and computer programming
the defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines is that they can be programmed
that is to say that a list of instructions
the program
can be given to the computer and it will store them and carry them out at some time in the future
in most cases
computer instructions are simple
add one number to another
move some data from one location to another
send a message to some external device
etc
these instructions are read from the computer
s memory and are generally carried out
executed
in the order they were given
however
there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there
these are called
jump
instructions
or branches
furthermore
jump instructions may be made to happen conditionally so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event
many computers directly support subroutines by providing a type of jump that
remembers
the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump instruction
program execution might be likened to reading a book
while a person will normally read each word and line in sequence
they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest
similarly
a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met
this is called the flow of control within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention
comparatively
a person using a pocket calculator can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses
but to add together all of the numbers from
to
would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time
with a near certainty of making a mistake
on the other hand
a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions
for example
mov
sum
set sum to
mov
num
set num to
loop
add num
sum
add num to sum
add
num
add
to num
cmp num
compare num to
ble loop
if num
go back to
loop
halt
end of program
stop running
once told to run this program
the computer will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention
it will almost never make a mistake and a modern pc can complete the task in about a millionth of a second
however
computers cannot
think
for themselves in the sense that they only solve problems in exactly the way they are programmed to
an intelligent human faced with the above addition task might soon realize that instead of actually adding up all the numbers one can simply use the equation
over
and arrive at the correct answer
with little work
in other words
a computer programmed to add up the numbers one by one as in the example above would do exactly that without regard to efficiency or alternative solutions
programs
s punched card containing one line from a fortran program
the card reads
and is labelled
proj
for identification purposes
in practical terms
a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions
as do the programs for word processors and web browsers for example
a typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second
gigaflops
and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation
large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of programmers years to write
and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors
errors in computer programs are called
bugs
bugs may be benign and not affect the usefulness of the program
or have only subtle effects
but in some cases they may cause the program to
hang
become unresponsive to input such as mouse clicks or keystrokes
or to completely fail or
crash
otherwise benign bugs may sometimes may be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user writing an
exploit
code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer
s proper execution
bugs are usually not the fault of the computer
since computers merely execute the instructions they are given
bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the program
s design
in most computers
individual instructions are stored as machine code with each instruction being given a unique number
its operation code or opcode for short
the command to add two numbers together would have one opcode
the command to multiply them would have a different opcode and so on
the simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions
the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from
each with a unique numerical code
since the computer
s memory is able to store numbers
it can also store the instruction codes
this leads to the important fact that entire programs
which are just lists of these instructions
can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data
the fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer
s memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von neumann
or stored program
architecture
in some cases
a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on
this is called the harvard architecture after the harvard mark i computer
modern von neumann computers display some traits of the harvard architecture in their designs
such as in cpu caches
while it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers
machine language
and while this technique was used with many early computers
it is extremely tedious and potentially error
prone to do so in practice
especially for complicated programs
instead
each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember
a mnemonic such as add
sub
mult or jump
these mnemonics are collectively known as a computer
s assembly language
converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand
machine language
is usually done by a computer program called an assembler
machine languages and the assembly languages that represent them
collectively termed low
level programming languages
tend to be unique to a particular type of computer
for instance
an arm architecture computer
such as may be found in a pda or a hand
held videogame
cannot understand the machine language of an intel pentium or the amd athlon
computer that might be in a pc
though considerably easier than in machine language
writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and is also error prone
therefore
most practical programs are written in more abstract high
level programming languages that are able to express the needs of the programmer more conveniently
and thereby help reduce programmer error
high level languages are usually
compiled
into machine language
or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language
using another computer program called a compiler
high level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than assembly language
and more related to the language and structure of the problem
to be solved by the final program
it is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer
this is part of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such as personal computers and various video game consoles
the task of developing large software systems presents a significant intellectual challenge
producing software with an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has historically been difficult
the academic and professional discipline of software engineering concentrates specifically on this challenge
example
a traffic light showing red
suppose a computer is being employed to operate a traffic light at an intersection between two streets
the computer has the following three basic instructions
on
streetname
color
turns the light on streetname with a specified color on
off
streetname
color
turns the light on streetname with a specified color off
wait
seconds
waits a specifed number of seconds
start starts the program
repeat tells the computer to repeat a specified part of the program in a loop
comments are marked with a
on the left margin
comments in a computer program do not affect the operation of the program
they are not evaluated by the computer
assume the streetnames are broadway and main

main
yellow

main
red
tell computer to continuously repeat the program
repeat all
with this set of instructions
the computer would cycle the light continually through red
green
yellow and back to red again on both streets
however
suppose there is a simple on
off switch connected to the computer that is intended to be used to make the light flash red while some maintenance operation is being performed
the program might then instruct the computer to
start
if switch
off then
normal traffic signal operation
let broadway traffic go
off
broadway

on
broadway
green

stop broadway traffic

turn the red lights off and wait

tell the computer to repeat the statements in this section
repeat this section
in this manner
the traffic signal will run a flash
red program when the switch is on
and will run the normal program when the switch is off
both of these program examples show the basic layout of a computer program in a simple
familiar context of a traffic signal
any experienced programmer can spot many software bugs in the program
for instance
not making sure that the green light is off when the switch is set to flash red
however
to remove all possible bugs would make this program much longer and more complicated
and would be confusing to nontechnical readers
the aim of this example is a simple demonstration of how computer instructions are laid out
function
main articles
central processing unit and microprocessor
a general purpose computer has four main components
the arithmetic logic unit
alu
the control unit
the memory
and the input and output devices
collectively termed i
these parts are interconnected by busses
often made of groups of wires
inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small electrical circuits which can be turned off or on by means of an electronic switch
each circuit represents a bit
binary digit
of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a
and when off it represents a
in positive logic representation
the circuits are arranged in logic gates so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the other circuits
the control unit
alu
registers
and basic i
and often other hardware closely linked with these
are collectively known as a central processing unit
cpu
early cpus were composed of many separate components but since the mid
s cpus have typically been constructed on a single integrated circuit called a microprocessor
control unit
main articles
cpu design and control unit
diagram showing how a particular mips architecture instruction would be decoded by the control system
the control unit
often called a control system or central controller
manages the computer
s various components
it reads and interprets
decodes
the program instructions
transforming them into a series of control signals which activate other parts of the computer
control systems in advanced computers may change the order of some instructions so as to improve performance
a key component common to all cpus is the program counter
a special memory cell
a register
that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction is to be read from
the control system
s function is as follows
note that this is a simplified description
and some of these steps may be performed concurrently or in a different order depending on the type of cpu
read the code for the next instruction from the cell indicated by the program counter
decode the numerical code for the instruction into a set of commands or signals for each of the other systems
increment the program counter so it points to the next instruction
read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory
or perhaps from an input device
the location of this required data is typically stored within the instruction code
provide the necessary data to an alu or register
if the instruction requires an alu or specialized hardware to complete
instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation
write the result from the alu back to a memory location or to a register or perhaps an output device
jump back to step
since the program counter is
conceptually
just another set of memory cells
it can be changed by calculations done in the alu
adding
to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place
locations further down the program
instructions that modify the program counter are often known as
jumps
and allow for loops
instructions that are repeated by the computer
and often conditional instruction execution
both examples of control flow
it is noticeable that the sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program
and indeed
in some more complex cpu designs
there is another yet smaller computer called a microsequencer that runs a microcode program that causes all of these events to happen
arithmetic
logic unit
alu
main article
arithmetic logic unit
the alu is capable of performing two classes of operations
arithmetic and logic
the set of arithmetic operations that a particular alu supports may be limited to adding and subtracting or might include multiplying or dividing
trigonometry functions
sine
cosine
etc
and square roots
some can only operate on whole numbers
integers
whilst others use floating point to represent real numbers
albeit with limited precision
however
any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform
therefore
any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation
although it will take more time to do so if its alu does not directly support the operation
an alu may also compare numbers and return boolean truth values
true or false
depending on whether one is equal to
greater than or less than the other
is
greater than
logic operations involve boolean logic
and
or
xor and not
these can be useful both for creating complicated conditional statements and processing boolean logic
superscalar computers may contain multiple alus so that they can process several instructions at the same time
graphics processors and computers with simd and mimd features often provide alus that can perform arithmetic on vectors and matrices
memory
main article
computer data storage
magnetic core memory was the computer memory of choice throughout the
until it was replaced by semiconductor memory
a computer
s memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers can be placed or read
each cell has a numbered
address
and can store a single number
the computer can be instructed to
put the number
into the cell numbered
or to
add the number that is in cell
to the number that is in cell
and put the answer into cell
the information stored in memory may represent practically anything
letters
numbers
even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease
since the cpu does not differentiate between different types of information
it is the software
s responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers
in almost all modern computers
each memory cell is set up to store binary numbers in groups of eight bits
called a byte
each byte is able to represent
different numbers
either from
to
or
to
to store larger numbers
several consecutive bytes may be used
typically
two
four or eight
when negative numbers are required
they are usually stored in two
s complement notation
other arrangements are possible
but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts
a computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically
modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory
the cpu contains a special set of memory cells called registers that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area
there are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of cpu
registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed
as data is constantly being worked on
reducing the need to access main memory
which is often slow compared to the alu and control units
greatly increases the computer
s speed
computer main memory comes in two principal varieties
random
access memory or ram and read
only memory or rom
ram can be read and written to anytime the cpu commands it
but rom is pre
loaded with data and software that never changes
so the cpu can only read from it
rom is typically used to store the computer
s initial start
up instructions
in general
the contents of ram are erased when the power to the computer is turned off
but rom retains its data indefinitely
in a pc
the rom contains a specialized program called the bios that orchestrates loading the computer
s operating system from the hard disk drive into ram whenever the computer is turned on or reset
in embedded computers
which frequently do not have disk drives
all of the required software may be stored in rom
software stored in rom is often called firmware
because it is notionally more like hardware than software
flash memory blurs the distinction between rom and ram
as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable
it is typically much slower than conventional rom and ram however
so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary
in more sophisticated computers there may be one or more ram cache memories which are slower than registers but faster than main memory
generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically
often without the need for any intervention on the programmer

modern desktop computers contain many smaller computers that assist the main cpu in performing i
multitasking
main article
computer multitasking
while a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory
in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously
this is achieved by multitasking i
having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn
one means by which this is done is with a special signal called an interrupt which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead
by remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt
the computer can return to that task later
if several programs are running
at the same time
then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second
causing a program switch each time
since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception
it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant
this method of multitasking is sometimes termed
time
sharing
since each program is allocated a
slice
of time in turn
before the era of cheap computers
the principle use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the same computer
seemingly
multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly
in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running
however
most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input
output devices to complete their tasks
if a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard
then it will not take a
time slice
until the event it is waiting for has occurred
this frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run at the same time without unacceptable speed loss
multiprocessing
main article
multiprocessing
cray designed many supercomputers that used multiprocessing heavily
some computers are designed to distribute their work across several cpus in a multiprocessing configuration
a technique once employed only in large and powerful machines such as supercomputers
mainframe computers and servers
multiprocessor and multi
core
multiple cpus on a single integrated circuit
personal and laptop computers are now widely available
and are being increasingly used in lower
end markets as a result
supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored
program architecture and from general purpose computers
they often feature thousands of cpus
customized high
speed interconnects
and specialized computing hardware
such designs tend to be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to successfully utilize most of the available resources at once
supercomputers usually see usage in large
scale simulation

visualization of a portion of the routes on the internet
computers have been used to coordinate information between multiple locations since the
the u
military
s sage system was the first large
scale example of such a system
which led to a number of special
purpose commercial systems like sabre
in the
computer engineers at research institutions throughout the united states began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology
this effort was funded by arpa
now darpa
and the computer network that it produced was called the arpanet
the technologies that made the arpanet possible spread and evolved
in time
the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the internet
the emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer
computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network
such as peripheral devices
stored information
and the like
as extensions of the resources of an individual computer
initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high
tech environments
but in the
s the spread of applications like e
mail and the world wide web
combined with the development of cheap
fast networking technologies like ethernet and adsl saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous
in fact
the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally
a very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the internet to communicate and receive information
wireless
networking
often utilizing mobile phone networks
has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments

programming languages
programming languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run
unlike natural languages
programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise
they are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud
they are generally either translated into machine code by a compiler or an assembler before being run
or translated directly at run time by an interpreter
sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques
there are thousands of different programming languages

others useful only for highly specialized applications

hard drive
hdd
is a non
volatile storage device for digital data
it features one or more rotating rigid platters on a motor
driven spindle within a metal case
data is encoded magnetically by read
write heads that float on a cushion of air above the platters
with modern storage capacity measured in gigabytes
gb
and terabytes
tb
hard disk manufacturers quote disk capacity in si
standard powers of
wherein a terabyte is
gigabytes and a gigabyte is
megabytes

available space appears somewhat less than advertised capacity
the first hdd was invented by ibm in
they have fallen in size and cost over the years
displacing floppy disks in the late
s as the preferred long
term storage mechanism for personal computers
most desktop systems today have standardized on the
form factor
and though mobile systems most often use
drives
both sizes operate on similar high
speed serial interfaces

were originally developed for use with general purpose computers
during the
the need for large
scale
reliable storage
independent of a particular device
led to the introduction of embedded systems such as raid systems
network attached storage

diagram of a computer hard disk drive
hdds record data by magnetizing ferromagnetic material directionally
to represent either a
or a
binary digit
they read the data back by detecting the magnetization of the material
a typical hdd design consists of a spindle that holds one or more flat circular disks called platters
onto which the data is recorded
the platters are made from a non
magnetic material
usually aluminum alloy or glass
and are coated with a thin layer of magnetic material
typically
nm in thickness
for reference
standard copy paper is
millimetre
nm
thick
with an outer layer of carbon for protection
older disks used iron
iii
oxide as the magnetic material
but current disks use a cobalt
based alloy
a cross section of the magnetic surface in action
in this case the binary data is encoded using frequency modulation
the platters are spun at very high speeds
information is written to a platter as it rotates past devices called read
and
write heads that operate very close
tens of nanometers in new drives
over the magnetic surface
the read
and
write head is used to detect and modify the magnetization of the material immediately under it
in modern drives there is one head for each magnetic platter surface on the spindle
mounted on a common arm
an actuator arm
or access arm
moves the heads on an arc
roughly radially
across the platters as they spin
allowing each head to access almost the entire surface of the platter as it spins
the arm is moved using a voice coil actuator or in some older designs a stepper motor
the magnetic surface of each platter is conceptually divided into many small sub
micrometre
sized magnetic regions
each of which is used to encode a single binary unit of information
initially the regions were oriented horizontally
but beginning about
the orientation was changed to perpendicular
due to the polycrystalline nature of the magnetic material each of these magnetic regions is composed of a few hundred magnetic grains
magnetic grains are typically
nm in size and each form a single magnetic domain
each magnetic region in total forms a magnetic dipole which generates a highly localized magnetic field nearby
a write head magnetizes a region by generating a strong local magnetic field
early hdds used an electromagnet both to magnetize the region and to then read its magnetic field by using electromagnetic induction
later versions of inductive heads included metal in gap
mig
heads and thin film heads
as data density increased
read heads using magnetoresistance
mr
came into use
the electrical resistance of the head changed according to the strength of the magnetism from the platter
later development made use of spintronics
in these heads
the magnetoresistive effect was much greater than in earlier types
and was dubbed
giant
magnetoresistance
gmr
in today
s heads
the read and write elements are separate
but in close proximity
on the head portion of an actuator arm
the read element is typically magneto
resistive while the write element is typically thin
film inductive
hd heads are kept from contacting the platter surface by the air that is extremely close to the platter
that air moves at
or close to
the platter speed
citation needed
the record and playback head are mounted on a block called a slider
and the surface next to the platter is shaped to keep it just barely out of contact
it
s a type of air bearing
in modern drives
the small size of the magnetic regions creates the danger that their magnetic state might be lost because of thermal effects
to counter this
the platters are coated with two parallel magnetic layers
separated by a
atom
thick layer of the non
magnetic element ruthenium
and the two layers are magnetized in opposite orientation
thus reinforcing each other
another technology used to overcome thermal effects to allow greater recording densities is perpendicular recording
first shipped in
and as of
the technology was used in many hdds
this section may require cleanup to meet wikipedia
s quality standards
please improve this section if you can
december
grain boundaries are very important to hdd design
the grains are very small and close to each other
so the coupling between adjacent grains is very strong
when one grain is magnetized
the adjacent grains tend to be aligned parallel to it or demagnetized
then both the stability of the data and signal
to
noise ratio will be sabotaged
a clear grain boundary can weaken the coupling of the grains and subsequently increase the signal
to
noise ratio
in longitudinal recording
the single
domain grains have uniaxial anisotropy with easy axes lying in the film plane
the consequence of this arrangement is that adjacent magnets repel each other
therefore the magnetostatic energy is so large that it is difficult to increase areal density
perpendicular recording media
on the other hand
has the easy axis of the grains oriented perpendicular to the disk plane
adjacent magnets attract to each other and magnetostatic energy is much lower
so
much higher areal density can be achieved in perpendicular recording
another unique feature in perpendicular recording is that a soft magnetic underlayer is incorporated into the recording disk
this underlayer is used to conduct writing magnetic flux so that the writing is more efficient
this will be discussed in writing process
therefore
a higher anisotropy medium film
such as l
fept and rare
earth magnets
can be used
edit
error handling
modern drives also make extensive use of error correcting codes
eccs
particularly reed
solomon error correction
these techniques store extra bits for each block of data that are determined by mathematical formulae
the extra bits allow many errors to be fixed
while these extra bits take up space on the hard drive
they allow higher recording densities to be employed
resulting in much larger storage capacity for user data
in
in the newest drives
low
density parity
check codes
ldpc
are supplanting reed
solomon
ldpc codes enable performance close to the shannon limit and thus allow for the highest storage density available
typical hard drives attempt to
remap
the data in a physical sector that is going bad to a spare physical sector
hopefully while the number of errors in that bad sector is still small enough that the ecc can completely recover the data without loss
the s
system counts the total number of errors in the entire hard drive fixed by ecc
and the total number of remappings
in an attempt to predict hard drive failure

architecture
a hard disk drive with the platters and motor hub removed showing the copper colored stator coils surrounding a bearing at the center of the spindle motor
the orange stripe along the side of the arm is a thin printed
circuit cable
the spindle bearing is in the center
a typical hard drive has two electric motors
one to spin the disks and one to position the read
write head assembly
the disk motor has an external rotor attached to the platters
the stator windings are fixed in place
the actuator has a read
write head under the tip of its very end
near center
a thin printed
circuit cable connects the read
write head to the hub of the actuator
a flexible
somewhat
shaped
ribbon cable
seen edge
on below and to the left of the actuator arm in the first image and more clearly in the second
continues the connection from the head to the controller board on the opposite side
the head support arm is very light
but also rigid
in modern drives
acceleration at the head reaches
gs
the silver
colored structure at the upper left of the first image is the top plate of the permanent
magnet and moving coil motor that swings the heads to the desired position
it is shown removed in the second image
the plate supports a thin neodymium
iron
boron
nib
high
flux magnet
beneath this plate is the moving coil
often referred to as the voice coil by analogy to the coil in loudspeakers
which is attached to the actuator hub
and beneath that is a second nib magnet
mounted on the bottom plate of the motor
some drives only have one magnet
the voice coil itself is shaped rather like an arrowhead
and made of doubly coated copper magnet wire
the inner layer is insulation
and the outer is thermoplastic
which bonds the coil together after it
s wound on a form
making it self
supporting
the portions of the coil along the two sides of the arrowhead
which point to the actuator bearing center
interact with the magnetic field
developing a tangential force that rotates the actuator
current flowing radially outward along one side of the arrowhead and radially inward on the other produces the tangential force
if the magnetic field were uniform
each side would generate opposing forces that would cancel each other out
therefore the surface of the magnet is half n pole
half s pole
with the radial dividing line in the middle
causing the two sides of the coil to see opposite magnetic fields and produce forces that add instead of canceling
currents along the top and bottom of the coil produce radial forces that do not rotate the head

and can achieve sequential media transfer speeds above
gbit
and a sustained transfer rate up to

drives running at
or
rpm use smaller platters to mitigate increased power requirements
as they have less air drag
and therefore generally have lower capacity than the highest capacity desktop drives
enterprise drives commonly operate continuously
in demanding environments while delivering the highest possible performance without sacrificing reliability
maximum capacity is not the primary goal
and as a result the drives are often offered in capacities that are relatively low in relation to their cost
mobile hdds
laptop hdds
which are physically smaller than their desktop and enterprise counterparts
tend to be slower and have lower capacity
a typical mobile hdd spins at either
rpm
rpm
or
rpm
with
rpm being the most prominent
rpm drives tend to be more expensive and have smaller capacities
while
rpm models usually have very high storage capacities
because of physically smaller platter
mobile hdds generally have lower capacity than their larger desktop counterparts
the exponential increases in disk space and data access speeds of hdds have enabled the commercial viability of consumer products that require large storage capacities
such as digital video recorders and digital audio players
in addition
the availability of vast amounts of cheap storage has made viable a variety of web
based services with extraordinary capacity requirements
such as free
of
charge web search
web archiving and video sharing
google
internet archive
youtube
etc
the main way to decrease access time is to increase rotational speed
thus reducing rotational delay
while the main way to increase throughput and storage capacity is to increase areal density
based on historic trends
analysts predict a future growth in hdd bit density
and therefore capacity
of about
per year
access times have not kept up with throughput increases
which themselves have not kept up with growth in storage capacity
the expected random iops capability of any hdd can be calculated by dividing
msecs by the sum of the average seek time and the average rotational latency

is an area of a hard drive that is not normally visible to an operating system

hdd formatting
modern hdds
such as sas and sata drives
appear to the host as a contiguous set of logical blocks
typically
bytes long but the industry is in the process of changing to
byte logical blocks
the process of relating these logical blocks to their physical location on the hdd is called low level formatting which is usually performed at the factory and is not normally changed in the field
high level formatting then writes the file system structures into selected logical blocks to make the remaining logical blocks available to the host os and its applications
some modern disk systems on mainframes simulate older formats on top of sector oriented hardware

capacity measurements
a disassembled and labeled
hard drive
all major components were placed on a mirror
which created the symmetrical reflections
raw unformatted capacity of a hard disk drive is usually quoted with si prefixes
metric system prefixes
incrementing by powers of
today that usually means gigabytes
gb
and terabytes
tb
this is conventional for data speeds and memory sizes which are not inherently manufactured in power of two sizes
as ram and flash memory are
hard disks by contrast have no inherent binary size as capacity is determined by number of heads
tracks and sectors
this can cause some confusion because some operating systems may report the formatted capacity of a hard drive using binary prefix units which increment by powers of
a one terabyte
tb
disk drive would be expected to hold around
trillion bytes
or
gb
and indeed most
tb hard drives will contain slightly more than this number
however some operating system utilities would report this as around
gb or
mb
the actual number for a formatted capacity will be somewhat smaller still
depending on the file system

microsoft windows reports disk capacity both in a decimal integer to
or more digits and in binary prefix units to three significant digits
the capacity of an hdd can be calculated by multiplying the number of cylinders by the number of heads by the number of sectors by the number of bytes
sector
most commonly
drives with the ata interface and a capacity of eight gigabytes or more behave as if they were structured into
cylinders
heads
and
sectors
for compatibility with older operating systems
unlike in the
the cylinder
head
sector
counts reported to the cpu by a modern ata drive are no longer actual physical parameters since the reported numbers are constrained by historic operating
system interfaces and with zone bit recording the actual number of sectors varies by zone
disks with scsi interface address each sector with a unique integer number
the operating system remains ignorant of their head or cylinder count
the old c
s scheme has been replaced by logical block addressing
in some cases
to try to
force
fit
the c
s scheme to large
capacity drives
the number of heads was given as
although no modern drive has anywhere near
platters
for a formatted drive
the operating system
s file system internal usage is another
although minor
reason why a computer hard drive or storage device
s capacity may show its capacity as different from its theoretical capacity
this would include storage for
as examples
a file allocation table
fat
or inodes
as well as other operating system data structures
this file system overhead is usually less than
on drives larger than
mb
for raid drives
data integrity and fault
tolerance requirements also reduce the realized capacity
for example
a raid
drive will be about half the total capacity as a result of data mirroring
for raid
drives with x drives you would lose
x of your space to parity
raid drives are multiple drives that appear to be one drive to the user
but provides some fault
tolerance
a general rule of thumb to quickly convert the manufacturer
s hard disk capacity to the standard microsoft windows formatted capacity is
capacity of hdd from manufacturer for hdds less than a terabyte and
capacity of hdd from manufacturer for hdds equal to or greater than
terabyte

performance characteristics
edit
data transfer rate
as of
a typical
rpm desktop hard drive has a sustained
disk
to
buffer
data transfer rate of about
megabytes per second
this rate depends on the track location
so it will be higher for data on the outer tracks
where there are more data sectors
and lower toward the inner tracks
where there are fewer data sectors
and is generally somewhat higher for
rpm drives
a current widely used standard for the
buffer
to
computer
interface is
gbit
s sata
which can send about
megabyte
s from the buffer to the computer
and thus is still comfortably ahead of today
s disk
to
buffer transfer rates
data transfer rate
read
write
can be measured by writing a large file to disk using special file generator tools
then reading back the file
transfer rate can be influenced by file system fragmentation and the layout of the files
the mechanical nature of hard disks introduces certain performance compromises
the manipulation of sequential data depends upon the rotational speed of the platters and the data recording density
because heat and vibration limit rotational speed
advancing density becomes the sole method to improve sequential transfer rates
while these advances exponentially increase storage capacity
the performance gains they enable are linear
throughput relative to capacity in new generations of hard disks has therefore fallen with time
edit
seek time
seek time for non
sequential data ranges from
ms for high
end server drives
to
ms for mobile drives
with the most common mobile drives at about
ms and the most common desktop type typically being around
ms there has not been any significant improvement in this speed for some years
some early pc drives used a stepper motor to move the heads
and as a result had access times as slow as
ms
but this was quickly improved by voice coil type actuation in the late
reducing access times to around
ms
edit
power consumption
power consumption has become increasingly important
not just in mobile devices such as laptops but also in server and desktop markets
increasing data center machine density has led to problems delivering sufficient power to devices
especially for spin up
and getting rid of the waste heat subsequently produced
as well as environmental and electrical cost concerns
see green computing
similar issues exist for large companies with thousands of desktop pcs
smaller form factor drives often use less power than larger drives
one interesting development in this area is actively controlling the seek speed so that the head arrives at its destination only just in time to read the sector
rather than arriving as quickly as possible and then having to wait for the sector to come around
the rotational latency
many of the hard drive companies are now producing green drives that require much less power and cooling
many of these
green drives
spin slower
rpm compared to
or
rpm
and also generate less waste heat
also in server and workstation systems where there might be multiple hard disk drives
there are various ways of controlling when the hard drives spin up
highest power draw
on scsi hard disk drives
the scsi controller can directly control spin up and spin down of the drives
on parallel ata
aka pata
and sata hard disk drives
some support power
up in standby or puis
the hard disk drive will not spin up until the controller or system bios issues a specific command to do so
this limits the power draw or consumption upon power on
on newer sata hard disk drives
there is staggered spin up feature
the hard disk drive will not spin up until the sata phy comes ready
communications with the host controller starts
citation needed
to further control or reduce power draw and consumption
the hard disk drive can be spun down to reduce its power consumption
edit
audible noise
measured in dba
audible noise is significant for certain applications
such as pvrs
digital audio recording and quiet computers
low noise disks typically use fluid bearings
slower rotational speeds
usually
rpm
and reduce the seek speed under load
aam
to reduce audible clicks and crunching sounds
drives in smaller form factors
inch
are often quieter than larger drives
edit
shock resistance
shock resistance is especially important for mobile devices
some laptops now include active hard drive protection that parks the disk heads if the machine is dropped
hopefully before impact
to offer the greatest possible chance of survival in such an event
maximum shock tolerance to date is
gs for operating and
gs for non
operating

hard disk drives are accessed over one of a number of bus types
including parallel ata
ata
also called ide or eide
serial ata
sata
scsi
serial attached scsi
sas
and fibre channel
bridge circuitry is sometimes used to connect hard disk drives to buses that they cannot communicate with natively
such as ieee
usb and scsi
for the st
interface
the data encoding scheme as written to the disk surface was also important
the first st
disks used modified frequency modulation
mfm
encoding
and transferred data at a rate of
megabits per second
later controllers using
rll
or just
rll
encoding caused
more data to appear under the heads compared to one rotation of an mfm drive
increasing data storage and data transfer rate by
to
megabits per second
many st
interface disk drives were only specified by the manufacturer to run at the
rd lower mfm data transfer rate compared to rll
while other drive models
usually more expensive versions of the same drive
were specified to run at the higher rll data transfer rate
in some cases
a drive had sufficient margin to allow the mfm specified model to run at the denser
faster rll data transfer rate
not recommended nor guaranteed by manufacturers
also
any rll
certified drive could run on any mfm controller
but with
less data capacity and as much as
rd less data transfer rate compared to its rll specifications
enhanced small disk interface
esdi
also supported multiple data rates
esdi disks always used
rll
but at
or
megabits per second
but this was usually negotiated automatically by the disk drive and controller
most of the time
however
or
megabit esdi disk drives weren
t downward compatible
or
megabit disk drive wouldn
t run on a
megabit controller
esdi disk drives typically also had jumpers to set the number of sectors per track and
in some cases
sector size
modern hard drives present a consistent interface to the rest of the computer
no matter what data encoding scheme is used internally
typically a dsp in the electronics inside the hard drive takes the raw analog voltages from the read head and uses prml and reed
solomon error correction to decode the sector boundaries and sector data
then sends that data out the standard interface
that dsp also watches the error rate detected by error detection and correction
and performs bad sector remapping
data collection for self
monitoring
analysis
and reporting technology
and other internal tasks
scsi originally had just one signaling frequency of
mhz for a maximum data rate of
megabytes
second over
parallel conductors
but later this was increased dramatically
the scsi bus speed had no bearing on the disk
s internal speed because of buffering between the scsi bus and the disk drive
s internal data bus
however
many early disk drives had very small buffers
and thus had to be reformatted to a different interleave
just like st
disks
when used on slow computers
such as early commodore amiga
ibm pc compatibles and apple macintoshes
ata disks have typically had no problems with interleave or data rate
due to their controller design
but many early models were incompatible with each other and couldn
t run with two devices on the same physical cable in a master
slave setup
this was mostly remedied by the mid
when ata
s specification was standardized and the details began to be cleaned up
but still causes problems occasionally
especially with cd
rom and dvd
rom disks
and when mixing ultra dma and non
udma devices
serial ata does away with master
slave setups entirely
placing each disk on its own channel
with its own set of i
o ports
instead
firewire
ieee
and usb
hdds are external units containing generally ata or scsi disks with ports on the back allowing very simple and effective expansion and mobility
most firewire
ieee
models are able to daisy
chain in order to continue adding peripherals without requiring additional ports on the computer itself
usb however
is a point to point network and doesn
t allow for daisy
chaining
usb hubs are used to increase the number of available ports and are used for devices that don
t require charging since the current supplied by hubs is typically lower than what
s available from the built
in usb ports

historical bit serial interfaces
connect a hard disk drive
hdd
to a hard disk controller
hdc
with two cables
one for control and one for data
each drive also has an additional cable for power
usually connecting it directly to the power supply unit
the hdc provided significant functions such as serial
parallel conversion
data separation
and track formatting
and required matching to the drive
after formatting
in order to assure reliability
each control cable could serve two or more drives
while a dedicated

south bridge
with one data

each drive also has an additional power cable
usually direct to the power supply unit
o fibre channel
fc
is a successor to parallel scsi interface on enterprise market
it is a serial protocol
in disk drives usually the fibre channel arbitrated loop
fc
al
connection topology is used
fc has much broader usage than mere disk interfaces
and it is the cornerstone of storage area networks
sans
recently other protocols for this field
like iscsi and ata over ethernet have been developed as well
confusingly
drives usually use copper twisted
pair cables for fibre channel
not fibre optics
the latter are traditionally reserved for larger devices
such as servers or disk array controllers
o serial ata
sata
the sata data cable has one data pair for differential transmission of data to the device
and one pair for differential receiving from the device
just like eia
that requires that data be transmitted serially
similar differential signaling system is used in rs
localtalk
usb
firewire
and differential scsi
o serial attached scsi
sas
the sas is a new generation serial communication protocol for devices designed to allow for much higher speed data transfers and is compatible with sata
sas uses a mechanically identical data and power connector to standard

hdds
and many server
oriented sas raid controllers are also capable of addressing sata hard drives
sas uses serial communication instead of the parallel method found in traditional scsi devices but still uses scsi commands
word serial interfaces
connect a hard disk drive to a host bus adapter
today typically integrated into the
south bridge
with one cable for combined data
control
as for all bit serial interfaces above
each drive also has an additional power cable
usually direct to the power supply unit
the earliest versions of these interfaces typically had a
bit parallel data transfer to
from the drive
but
bit versions became much more common
and there are
bit versions
modern variants have serial data transfer
the word nature of data transfer makes the design of a host bus adapter significantly simpler than that of the precursor hdd controller
o integrated drive electronics
ide
later renamed to ata
with the alias p
ata
parallel ata
retroactively added upon introduction of the new variant serial ata
the original name reflected the innovative integration of hdd controller with hdd itself
which was not found in earlier disks
moving the hdd controller from the interface card to the disk drive helped to standardize interfaces
and to reduce the cost and complexity
the
pin ide
ata connection transfers
bits of data at a time on the data cable
the data cable was originally
conductor
but later higher speed requirements for data transfer to and from the hard drive led to an
ultra dma
mode
known as udma
progressively faster versions of this standard ultimately added the requirement for an
conductor variant of the same cable
where half of the conductors provides grounding necessary for enhanced high
speed signal quality by reducing cross talk
the interface for
conductor only has
pins
the missing pin acting as a key to prevent incorrect insertion of the connector to an incompatible socket
a common cause of disk and controller damage
o eide was an unofficial update
by western digital
to the original ide standard
with the key improvement being the use of direct memory access
dma
to transfer data between the disk and the computer without the involvement of the cpu
an improvement later adopted by the official ata standards
by directly transferring data between memory and disk
dma eliminates the need for the cpu to copy byte per byte
therefore allowing it to process other tasks while the data transfer occurs
o small computer system interface
scsi
originally named sasi for shugart associates system interface
was an early competitor of esdi
scsi disks were standard on servers
workstations
commodore amiga and apple macintosh computers through the mid
by which time most models had been transitioned to ide
and later
sata
family disks
only in
did the capacity of scsi disks fall behind ide disk technology
though the highest
performance disks are still available in scsi and fibre channel only
the length limitations of the data cable allows for external scsi devices
originally scsi data cables used single ended
common mode
data transmission
but server class scsi could use differential transmission
either low voltage differential
lvd
or high voltage differential
hvd
low
and
high
voltages for differential scsi are relative to scsi standards and do not meet the meaning of low voltage and high voltage as used in general electrical engineering contexts
as apply e
to statutory electrical codes
both lvd and hvd use low voltage signals

the head is simply pressed against the disk by the suspension
close
up of a hard disk head resting on a disk platter
a reflection of the head and its suspension is visible on the mirror
like disk
due to the extremely close spacing between the heads and the disk surface
any contamination of the read
write heads or platters can lead to a head crash
a failure of the disk in which the head scrapes across the platter surface
often grinding away the thin magnetic film and causing data loss
head crashes can be caused by electronic failure
a sudden power failure
physical shock
wear and tear
corrosion
or poorly manufactured platters and heads
the hdd
s spindle system relies on air pressure inside the disk enclosure to support the heads at their proper flying height while the disk rotates
hard disk drives require a certain range of air pressures in order to operate properly
the connection to the external environment and pressure occurs through a small hole in the enclosure
about
mm in diameter
usually with a filter on the inside
the breather filter
if the air pressure is too low
then there is not enough lift for the flying head
so the head gets too close to the disk
and there is a risk of head crashes and data loss
specially manufactured sealed and pressurized disks are needed for reliable high
altitude operation
above about
feet
modern disks include temperature sensors and adjust their operation to the operating environment
breather holes can be seen on all disk drives
they usually have a sticker next to them
warning the user not to cover the holes
the air inside the operating drive is constantly moving too
being swept in motion by friction with the spinning platters
this air passes through an internal recirculation
or
recirc
filter to remove any leftover contaminants from manufacture
any particles or chemicals that may have somehow entered the enclosure
and any particles or outgassing generated internally in normal operation
very high humidity for extended periods can corrode the heads and platters
for giant magnetoresistive
gmr
heads in particular
a minor head crash from contamination
that does not remove the magnetic surface of the disk
still results in the head temporarily overheating
due to friction with the disk surface
and can render the data unreadable for a short period until the head temperature stabilizes
so called
thermal asperity
a problem which can partially be dealt with by proper electronic filtering of the read signal
edit
actuation of moving arm
the hard drive
s electronics control the movement of the actuator and the rotation of the disk
and perform reads and writes on demand from the disk controller
feedback of the drive electronics is accomplished by means of special segments of the disk dedicated to servo feedback
these are either complete concentric circles
in the case of dedicated servo technology
or segments interspersed with real data
in the case of embedded servo technology
the servo feedback optimizes the signal to noise ratio of the gmr sensors by adjusting the voice
coil of the actuated arm
the spinning of the disk also uses a servo motor
modern disk firmware is capable of scheduling reads and writes efficiently on the platter surfaces and remapping sectors of the media which have failed

modern hdds prevent power interruptions or other malfunctions from landing its heads in the data zone by parking the heads either in a landing zone or by unloading

the heads
some early pc hdds did not park the heads automatically and they would land on data
in some other early units the user manually parked the heads by running a program to park the hdd
s heads
a landing zone is an area of the platter usually near its inner diameter
id
where no data is stored
this area is called the contact start
stop
css
zone
disks are designed such that either a spring or
more recently
rotational inertia in the platters is used to park the heads in the case of unexpected power loss
in this case
the spindle motor temporarily acts as a generator
providing power to the actuator
spring tension from the head mounting constantly pushes the heads towards the platter
while the disk is spinning
the heads are supported by an air bearing and experience no physical contact or wear
in css drives the sliders carrying the head sensors
often also just called heads
are designed to survive a number of landings and takeoffs from the media surface
though wear and tear on these microscopic components eventually takes its toll
most manufacturers design the sliders to survive
contact cycles before the chance of damage on startup rises above
however
the decay rate is not linear
when a disk is younger and has had fewer start
stop cycles
it has a better chance of surviving the next startup than an older
higher
mileage disk
as the head literally drags along the disk
s surface until the air bearing is established
for example
the seagate barracuda
series of desktop hard disks are rated to
start
stop cycles
in other words no failures attributed to the head
platter interface were seen before at least
start
stop cycles during testing
around
ibm pioneered a technology where a landing zone on the disk is made by a precision laser process
laser zone texture
lzt
producing an array of smooth nanometer
scale
bumps
in a landing zone
thus vastly improving stiction and wear performance
this technology is still largely in use today
predominantly in desktop and enterprise
inch
drives
in general
css technology can be prone to increased stiction
the tendency for the heads to stick to the platter surface
as a consequence of increased humidity
excessive stiction can cause physical damage to the platter and slider or spindle motor
load
unload technology relies on the heads being lifted off the platters into a safe location
thus eliminating the risks of wear and stiction altogether
the first hdd ramac and most early disk drives used complex mechanisms to load and unload the heads
modern hdds use ramp loading
first introduced by memorex in
to load
unload onto plastic
ramps
near the outer disk edge
all hdds today still use one of these two technologies listed above
each has a list of advantages and drawbacks in terms of loss of storage area on the disk
relative difficulty of mechanical tolerance control
non
operating shock robustness
cost of implementation
etc
addressing shock robustness
ibm also created a technology for their thinkpad line of laptop computers called the active protection system
when a sudden
sharp movement is detected by the built
in accelerometer in the thinkpad
internal hard disk heads automatically unload themselves to reduce the risk of any potential data loss or scratch defects
apple later also utilized this technology in their powerbook
ibook
macbook pro
and macbook line
known as the sudden motion sensor
sony
hp with their hp
d driveguard and toshiba have released similar technology in their notebook computers
this accelerometer based shock sensor has also been used for building cheap earthquake sensor networks

disk failures and their metrics
search wikibooks
wikibooks has a book on the topic of
minimizing hard disk drive failure and data loss
most major hard disk and motherboard vendors now support s
self
monitoring
analysis
and reporting technology
which measures drive characteristics such as operating temperature
spin
up time
data error rates
etc
certain trends and sudden changes in these parameters are thought to be associated with increased likelihood of drive failure and data loss
however
not all failures are predictable
normal use eventually can lead to a breakdown in the inherently fragile device
which makes it essential for the user to periodically back up the data onto a separate storage device
failure to do so can lead to the loss of data
while it may sometimes be possible to recover lost information
it is normally an extremely costly procedure
and it is not possible to guarantee success
study published by google suggested very little correlation between failure rates and either high temperature or activity level
however
the correlation between manufacturer
model and failure rate was relatively strong
statistics in this matter is kept highly secret by most entities
google did not publish the manufacturer
s names along with their respective failure rates
though they have since revealed that they use hitachi deskstar drives in some of their servers
while several s
parameters have an impact on failure probability
a large fraction of failed drives do not produce predictive s
parameters
parameters alone may not be useful for predicting individual drive failures
a common misconception is that a colder hard drive will last longer than a hotter hard drive
the google study seems to imply the reverse
lower temperatures are associated with higher failure rates
hard drives with s
reported average temperatures below
had higher failure rates than hard drives with the highest reported average temperature of
failure rates at least twice as high as the optimum s
reported temperature range of

sas and fc drives are typically more expensive and are traditionally used in servers and disk arrays
whereas inexpensive ata and sata drives evolved in the home computer market and were perceived to be less reliable
this distinction is now becoming blurred
the mean time between failures
mtbf
of sata drives is usually about
hours
some drives such as western digital raptor have rated
million hours mtbf
while scsi drives are rated for upwards of
million hours

however
independent research indicates that mtbf is not a reliable estimate of a drive
s longevity
mtbf is conducted in laboratory environments in test chambers and is an important metric to determine the quality of a disk drive before it enters high volume production
once the drive product is in production
the more valid metric is annualized failure rate

afr is the percentage of real

television
tv
is a widely used telecommunication medium for transmitting and receiving moving images
either monochromatic
black and white

or to view in the first person
commercially available since the late
the television set has become common in homes
businesses and institutions
particularly as a source of entertainment and news
since the
s the availability of video cassettes
laserdiscs
dvds and now blu
ray discs
have resulted in the television set frequently being used for viewing recorded as well as broadcast material
although other forms such as closed
circuit television
cctv
are in use
the most common usage of the medium is for broadcast television
which was modeled on the existing radio broadcasting systems developed in the
and uses high
powered radio
frequency transmitters to broadcast the television signal to individual tv receivers
broadcast tv is typically disseminated via radio transmissions on designated channels in the
megahertz frequency band
signals are now often transmitted with stereo and
or surround sound in many countries
until the
s broadcast tv programs were generally recorded and transmitted as an analog signal
but in recent years public and commercial broadcasters have been progressively introducing digital television broadcasting technology
a standard television set comprises multiple internal electronic circuits
including those for receiving and decoding broadcast signals
a visual display device which lacks a tuner is properly called a monitor
rather than a television
a television system may use different technical standards such as digital television
dtv
and high
definition television
hdtv
television systems are also used for surveillance
industrial process control
and guiding of weapons
in places where direct observation is difficult or dangerous
amateur television
ham tv or atv
is also used for experimentation
pleasure and public service events by amateur radio operators
ham tv stations were on the air in many cities before commercial tv stations came on the air

history of television
in its early stages of development
television employed a combination of optical
mechanical and electronic technologies to capture
transmit and display a visual image
by the late
however
those employing only optical and electronic technologies were being explored
all modern television systems rely on the latter
although the knowledge gained from the work on electromechanical systems was crucial in the development of fully electronic television
american family watching tv
the first images transmitted electrically were sent by early mechanical fax machines
including the pantelegraph
developed in the late
the concept of electrically powered transmission of television images in motion was first sketched in
as the telephonoscope
shortly after the invention of the telephone
at the time
it was imagined by early science fiction authors
that someday that light could be transmitted over wires
as sounds were
the idea of using scanning to transmit images was put to actual practical use in
in the pantelegraph
through the use of a pendulum
based scanning mechanism
from this period forward
scanning in one form or another has been used in nearly every image transmission technology to date
including television
this is the concept of
rasterization
the process of converting a visual image into a stream of electrical pulses
in
paul gottlieb nipkow
year old university student in germany
patented the first electromechanical television system which employed a scanning disk
a spinning disk with a series of holes spiraling toward the center
for rasterization
the holes were spaced at equal angular intervals such that in a single rotation the disk would allow light to pass through each hole and onto a light
sensitive selenium sensor which produced the electrical pulses
as an image was focused on the rotating disk
each hole captured a horizontal
slice
of the whole image
nipkow
s design would not be practical until advances in amplifier tube technology became available
the device was only useful for transmitting still
halftone
images
represented by equally spaced dots of varying size
over telegraph or telephone lines
citation needed
later designs would use a rotating mirror
drum scanner to capture the image and a cathode ray tube
crt
as a display device
but moving images were still not possible
due to the poor sensitivity of the selenium sensors
in
russian scientist boris rosing became the first inventor to use a crt in the receiver of an experimental television system
he used mirror
drum scanning to transmit simple geometric shapes to the crt
typical modern plasma screen televsion made by gradiente of brazil
scottish inventor john logie baird demonstrated the transmission of moving silhouette images in london in
and of moving
monochromatic images in
baird
s scanning disk produced an image of
lines resolution
just enough to discern a human face
from a double spiral of lenses
this demonstration by baird is generally agreed to be the worlds first true demonstration of television
albeit a mechanical form of television no longer in use
remarkably
in
baird also invented the world
s first video recording system
phonovision
by modulating the output signal of his tv camera down to the audio range he was able to capture the signal on a
inch wax audio disc using conventional audio recording technology
a handful of baird
phonovision
recordings survive and these were finally decoded and rendered into viewable images in the

getting tv programming shown to the public can happen in many different ways
after production the next step is to market and deliver the product to whatever markets are open to using it
this typically happens on two levels
original run or first run
a producer creates a program of one or multiple episodes and shows it on a station or network which has either paid for the production itself or to which a license has been granted by the producers to do the same
broadcast syndication
this is the terminology rather broadly used to describe secondary programming usages
beyond original run
it includes secondary runs in the country of first issue
but also international usage which may or may not be managed by the originating producer
in many cases other companies
tv stations or individuals are engaged to do the syndication work
in other words to sell the product into the markets they are allowed to sell into by contract from the copyright holders
in most cases the producers
first run programming is increasing on subscription services outside the u
but few domestically produced programs are syndicated on domestic free
to
air
fta
elsewhere
this practice is increasing however
generally on digital
only fta channels
or with subscriber
only first
run material appearing on fta
unlike the u
repeat fta screenings of a fta network program almost only occur on that network
also
affiliates rarely buy or produce non
network programming that is not centred around local events

advertising
television
s broad reach makes it a powerful and attractive medium for advertisers
many television networks and stations sell blocks of broadcast time to advertisers
sponsors
in order to fund their programming
edit
united states
since inception in the u
in
tv commercials have become one of the most effective
persuasive
and popular method of selling products of many sorts
especially consumer goods
during the
s and into the
programs were hosted by single advertisers
this
in turn
gave great creative license to the advertisers over the content of the show
due to the quiz show scandals in the
networks shifted to the magazine concept introducing commercial breaks with multiple advertisers
the networks effectively ended advertisers influence over television programming with this introduction
advertising rates are determined primarily by nielsen ratings
the time of the day and popularity of the channel determine how much a television commercial can cost
for example
the highly popular american idol can cost approximately
for a thirty second block of commercial time
while the same amount of time for the world cup and the super bowl can cost several million dollars
in recent years
the paid program or infomercial has become common
usually in lengths of
minutes or one hour
some drug companies and other businesses have even created
news
items for broadcast
known in the industry as video news releases
paying program directors to use them
some tv programs also weave advertisements into their shows
a practice begun in film and known as product placement
for example
a character could be drinking a certain kind of soda
going to a particular chain restaurant
or driving a certain make of car
this is sometimes very subtle
where shows have vehicles provided by manufacturers for low cost
rather than wrangling them
sometimes a specific brand or trade mark
or music from a certain artist or group
is used
this excludes guest appearances by artists
who perform on the show
edit
united kingdom
the tv regulator oversees tv advertising in the united kingdom
its restrictions have applied since the early days of commercially funded tv
despite this
an early tv mogul
roy thomson
likened the broadcasting licence as being a
licence to print money
restrictions mean that the big three national commercial tv channels
itv
channel
and five can show an average of only seven minutes of advertising per hour
eight minutes in the peak period
other broadcasters must average no more than nine minutes
twelve in the peak
this means that many imported tv shows from the us have unnatural breaks where the uk company has edited out the breaks intended for us advertising
advertisements must not be inserted in the course of certain specific proscribed types of programs which last less than half an hour in scheduled duration
this list includes any news or current affairs program
documentaries
and programs for children
nor may advertisements be carried in a program designed and broadcast for reception in schools or in any religious service or other devotional program
or during a formal royal ceremony or occasion
there also must be clear demarcations in time between the programs and the advertisements
the bbc
being strictly non
commercial is not allowed to show advertisements on television in the uk
although it has many advertising
funded channels abroad
the majority of its budget comes from tv licencing
see below
and the sale of content to other broadcasters

such advertisements are prohibited until after
pm
broadcasters in the republic of ireland adhere to broadcasting legislation implemented by the broadcasting commission of ireland and the european union
sponsorship of current affairs programming is prohibited at all times
as of october
the responsibilities held by the bci are gradually being transferred to the broadcasting authority of ireland
edit
taxation or license
television services in some countries may be funded by a television licence or a form of taxation which means advertising plays a lesser role or no role at all
for example
some channels may carry no advertising at all and some very little
including
australia
abc
norway
nrk
sweden
svt
united kingdom
bbc
the bbc carries no advertising on its uk channels and is funded by an annual licence paid by all households owning a television
this licence fee is set by government
but the bbc is not answerable to or controlled by government and is therefore genuinely independent
the two main bbc tv channels are watched by almost
percent of the population each week and overall have
per cent share of total viewing
this in spite of the fact that
of homes are multichannel
with
of these having access to
free to air channels via satellite and another
having access to
or more channels via freeview

when the same sporting event has been presented on both bbc and commercial channels
the bbc always attracts the lion
s share of the audience
indicating viewers prefer to watch tv uninterrupted by advertising
the australian broadcasting corporation
abc
carries no advertising
except for internal promotional material
as it is banned under the abc act
the abc receives its funding from the australian government every three years
in the
federal budget the abc received a
billion
the funds assist in providing the abc
s television

online and international outputs
the abc also receives funds from its many abc shops across australia
however funded by the australian government the editorial independence of the abc is ensured through law
in france and the republic of ireland government
funded channels carry advertisements yet those who own television sets have to pay an annual tax

genres
television genres include a broad range of programming types that entertain
inform
and educate viewers
the most expensive entertainment genres to produce are usually drama and dramatic miniseries
however
other genres
such as historical western genres
may also have high production costs
popular entertainment genres include action
oriented shows such as police
crime
detective dramas
horror
or thriller shows
as well
there are also other variants of the drama genre
such as medical dramas and daytime soap operas
science fiction shows can fall into either the drama or action category
depending on whether they emphasize philosophical questions or high adventure
comedy is a popular genre which includes situation comedy
sitcom
and animated shows for the adult demographic such as family guy
the least expensive forms of entertainment programming are game shows
talk shows
variety shows
and reality tv
game shows show contestants answering questions and solving puzzles to win prizes
talk shows feature interviews with film
television and music celebrities and public figures
variety shows feature a range of musical performers and other entertainers such as comedians and magicians introduced by a host or master of ceremonies
there is some crossover between some talk shows and variety shows
because leading talk shows often feature performances by bands
singers
comedians
and other performers in between the interview segments
reality tv shows

radio is the transmission of signals by modulation of electromagnetic waves with frequencies below those of visible light
electromagnetic radiation travels by means of oscillating electromagnetic fields that pass through the air and the vacuum of space
information is carried by systematically changing
modulating
some property of the radiated waves
such as amplitude
frequency
phase
or pulse width
when radio waves pass an electrical conductor
the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor
this can be detected and transformed into sound or other signals that carry information

etymology
originally
radio or radiotelegraphy was called
wireless telegraphy
which was shortened to
wireless
by the british
the prefix radio
in the sense of wireless transmission
was first recorded in the word radioconductor
coined by the french physicist
douard branly in
and based on the verb to radiate
in latin
radius
means
spoke of a wheel
beam of light
ray
radio
as a noun is said to have been coined by the advertising expert waldo warren
white
this word also appears in a
article by lee de forest
was adopted by the united states navy in
and became common by the time of the first commercial broadcasts in the united states in the
the noun
broadcasting
itself came from an agricultural term
meaning
scattering seeds widely
the term was then adopted by other languages in europe and asia
british commonwealth countries continued to mainly use the term
wireless
until the mid
th century
though the magazine of the bbc in the uk has been called radio times ever since it was first published in the early
in recent years the term
wireless
has gained renewed popularity through the rapid growth of short
range computer networking
wireless local area network
wlan
wifi
and bluetooth
as well as mobile telephony
gsm and umts
today
the term
radio
often refers to the actual transceiver device or chip
whereas
wireless
refers to the system and
or method used for radio communication
hence one talks about radio transceivers and radio frequency identification
rfid
but about wireless devices and wireless sensor networks
processes
radio systems used for communications will have the following elements
with more than
years of development
each process is implemented by a wide range of methods
specialized for different communications purposes
each system contains a transmitter
this consists of a source of electrical energy
producing alternating current of a desired frequency of oscillation
the transmitter contains a system to modulate
change
some property of the energy produced to impress a signal on it
this modulation might be as simple as turning the energy on and off
or altering more subtle properties such as amplitude
frequency
phase
or combinations of these properties
the transmitter sends the modulated electrical energy to a tuned resonant antenna
this structure converts the rapidly changing alternating current into an electromagnetic wave that can move through free space
sometimes with a particular polarization
electromagnetic waves travel through space either directly
or have their path altered by reflection
refraction or diffraction
the intensity of the waves diminishes due to geometric dispersion
the inverse
square law
some energy may also be absorbed by the intervening medium in some cases
noise will generally alter the desired signal
this electromagnetic interference comes from natural sources
as well as from artificial sources such as other transmitters and accidental radiators
noise is also produced at every step due to the inherent properties of the devices used
if the magnitude of the noise is large enough
the desired signal will no longer be discernible
this is the fundamental limit to the range of radio communications
the electromagnetic wave is intercepted by a tuned receiving antenna
this structure captures some of the energy of the wave and returns it to the form of oscillating electrical currents
at the receiver
these currents are demodulated
which is conversion to a usable signal form by a detector sub
system
the receiver is
tuned
to respond preferentially to the desired signals
and reject undesired signals
early radio systems relied entirely on the energy collected by an antenna to produce signals for the operator
radio became more useful after the invention of electronic devices such as the vacuum tube and later the transistor
which made it possible to amplify weak signals
today radio systems are used for applications from walkie
talkie children
s toys to the control of space vehicles
as well as for broadcasting
and many other applications
electromagnetic spectrum
main article
electromagnetic spectrum
radio frequencies occupy the range from a few tens of hertz to three hundred gigahertz
although commercially important uses of radio use only a small part of this spectrum
other types of electromagnetic radiation
with frequencies above the rf range
are microwave
infrared
visible light
ultraviolet
rays and gamma rays
since the energy of an individual photon of radio frequency is too low to remove an electron from an atom
radio waves are classified as non
ionizing radiation

invention of radio
the meaning and usage of the word
radio
has developed in parallel with developments within the field and can be seen to have three distinct phases
electromagnetic waves and experimentation
wireless communication and technical development
and radio broadcasting and commercialization
many individuals
inventors
engineers
developers
businessmen
contributed to produce the modern idea of radio and thus the origins and
invention
are multiple and controversial
early radio could not transmit sound or speech and was called the
wireless telegraph
development from a laboratory demonstration to a commercial entity spanned several decades and required the efforts of many practitioners
in
david e
hughes noticed that sparks could be heard in a telephone receiver when experimenting with his carbon microphone
he developed this carbon
based detector further and eventually could detect signals over a few hundred yards
he demonstrated his discovery to the royal society in
but was told it was merely induction
and therefore abandoned further research
experiments
later patented
were undertaken by thomas edison and his employees of menlo park
edison applied in
to the u
patent office for his patent on an electrostatic coupling system between elevated terminals
the patent was granted as u
patent
on december
the marconi company would later purchase rights to the edison patent to protect them legally from lawsuits

nikola tesla made devices for his experiments with electricity
addressing the franklin institute in philadelphia and the national electric light association
he described and demonstrated the principles of his wireless work
the descriptions contained all the elements that were later incorporated into radio systems before the development of the vacuum tube
he initially experimented with magnetic receivers
unlike the coherers
detecting devices consisting of tubes filled with iron filings which had been invented by temistocle calzecchi
onesti at fermo in italy in
used by guglielmo marconi and other early experimenters
a demonstration of wireless telegraphy took place in the lecture theater of the oxford university museum of natural history on august
carried out by professor oliver lodge and alexander muirhead
during the demonstration a radio signal was sent from the neighboring clarendon laboratory building
and received by apparatus in the lecture theater
in
alexander stepanovich popov built his first radio receiver
which contained a coherer
further refined as a lightning detector
it was presented to the russian physical and chemical society on may
a depiction of popov
s lightning detector was printed in the journal of the russian physical and chemical society the same year

amateur radio experimenters began to use personal computers with audio cards to process radio signals
in
the u

digital transmissions began to be applied to broadcasting in the late
uses of radio
early uses were maritime
for sending telegraphic messages using morse code between ships and land
the earliest users included the japanese navy scouting the russian fleet during the battle of tsushima in
one of the most memorable uses of marine telegraphy was during the sinking of the rms titanic in
including communications between operators on the sinking ship and nearby vessels
and communications to shore stations listing the survivors
radio was used to pass on orders and communications between armies and navies on both sides in world war i
germany used radio communications for diplomatic messages once it discovered that its submarine cables had been tapped by the british
the united states passed on president woodrow wilson

particularly in europe and the united states
besides broadcasting

point broadcasting
including telephone messages and relays of radio programs
became widespread in the

today
radio takes many forms
including wireless networks and mobile communications of all types
as well as radio broadcasting
before the advent of television
commercial radio broadcasts included not only news and music
but dramas
comedies
variety shows
and many other forms of entertainment
the era from
to the mid
s is commonly called radio
golden age
radio was unique among methods of dramatic presentation in that it used only sound

see radio programming
audio
a fisher
am
fm hi
fi receiver from
am radio uses amplitude modulation
in which the amplitude of the transmitted signal is made proportional to the sound amplitude captured
transduced
by the microphone
while the transmitted frequency remains unchanged
transmissions are affected by static and interference because lightning and other sources of radio emissions on the same frequency add their amplitudes to the original transmitted amplitude
in the early part of the
th century
american am radio stations broadcast with powers as high as
kw
and some could be heard worldwide
these stations
transmitters were commandeered for military use by the us government during world war ii
currently
the maximum broadcast power for a civilian am radio station in the united states and canada is
kw
and the majority of stations that emit signals this powerful were grandfathered in
see list of
kw am radio stations in the usa
in
ktnn received the last granted
watt license
these
kw stations are generally called
clear channel
stations
not to be confused with clear channel communications
because within north america each of these stations has exclusive use of its broadcast frequency throughout part or all of the broadcast day
bush house
home of the bbc world service
fm broadcast radio sends music and voice with higher fidelity than am radio
in frequency modulation
amplitude variation at the microphone causes the transmitter frequency to fluctuate
because the audio signal modulates the frequency and not the amplitude
an fm signal is not subject to static and interference in the same way as am signals
due to its need for a wider bandwidth
fm is transmitted in the very high frequency
vhf
mhz to
mhz
radio spectrum
vhf radio waves act more like light
traveling in straight lines
hence the reception range is generally limited to about
miles
during unusual upper atmospheric conditions
fm signals are occasionally reflected back towards the earth by the ionosphere
resulting in long distance fm reception
fm receivers are subject to the capture effect
which causes the radio to only receive the strongest signal when multiple signals appear on the same frequency
fm receivers are relatively immune to lightning and spark interference
high power is useful in penetrating buildings
diffracting around hills
and refracting in the dense atmosphere near the horizon for some distance beyond the horizon
consequently
watt fm stations can regularly be heard up to
miles
km
away
and farther
miles
km
if there are no competing signals
a few old
grandfathered
stations do not conform to these power rules
wbct
fm
in grand rapids
michigan
usa
runs
watts erp
and can increase to
watts erp by the terms of its original license
such a huge power level does not usually help to increase range as much as one might expect
because vhf frequencies travel in nearly straight lines over the horizon and off into space
nevertheless
when there were fewer fm stations competing
this station could be heard near bloomington
illinois
usa
almost
miles

fm subcarrier services are secondary signals transmitted in a
piggyback
fashion along with the main program
special receivers are required to utilize these services
analog channels may contain alternative programming
such as reading services for the blind
background music or stereo sound signals
in some extremely crowded metropolitan areas
the sub
channel program might be an alternate foreign language radio program for various ethnic groups
sub
carriers can also transmit digital data
such as station identification
the current song
s name
web addresses
or stock quotes
in some countries
fm radios automatically re
tune themselves to the same channel in a different district by using sub
bands
aviation voice radios use vhf am
am is used so that multiple stations on the same channel can be received
use of fm would result in stronger stations blocking out reception of weaker stations due to fm
s capture effect
aircraft fly high enough that their transmitters can be received hundreds of miles

even though they are using vhf
marine voice radios can use single sideband voice
ssb
in the shortwave high frequency
hf
mhz to
mhz
radio spectrum for very long ranges or narrowband fm in the vhf spectrum for much shorter ranges
narrowband fm sacrifices fidelity to make more channels available within the radio spectrum
by using a smaller range of radio frequencies
usually with five khz of deviation
versus the
khz used by commercial fm broadcasts
and
khz used for tv sound
government
police
fire and commercial voice services also use narrowband fm on special frequencies
early police radios used am receivers to receive one
way dispatches
civil and military hf
high frequency
voice services use shortwave radio to contact ships at sea
aircraft and isolated settlements
most use single sideband voice
ssb
which uses less bandwidth than am
on an am radio ssb sounds like ducks quacking
or the adults in a charlie brown cartoon
viewed as a graph of frequency versus power
an am signal shows power where the frequencies of the voice add and subtract with the main radio frequency
ssb cuts the bandwidth in half by suppressing the carrier and one of the sidebands
this also makes the transmitter about three times more powerful
because it doesn
t need to transmit the unused carrier and sideband

satellite phones use satellites rather than cell towers to communicate
video
television sends the picture as am and the sound as am or fm

navigation
all satellite navigation systems use satellites with precision clocks
the satellite transmits its position
and the time of the transmission
the receiver listens to four satellites
and can figure its position as being on a line that is tangent to a spherical shell around each satellite
determined by the time
of
flight of the radio signals from the satellite
a computer in the receiver does the math
radio direction
finding is the oldest form of radio navigation
before
navigators used movable loop antennas to locate commercial am stations near cities
in some cases they used marine radiolocation beacons
which share a range of frequencies just above am radio with amateur radio operators
loran systems also used time
of
flight radio signals
but from radio stations on the ground
vor
very high frequency omnidirectional range
systems
used by aircraft
have an antenna array that transmits two signals simultaneously
a directional signal rotates like a lighthouse at a fixed rate
when the directional signal is facing north
an omnidirectional signal pulses
by measuring the difference in phase of these two signals
an aircraft can determine its bearing or radial from the station
thus establishing a line of position
an aircraft can get readings from two vors and locate its position at the intersection of the two radials
known as a
fix
when the vor station is collocated with dme
distance measuring equipment
the aircraft can determine its bearing and range from the station
thus providing a fix from only one ground station
such stations are called vor
dmes
the military operates a similar system of navaids
called tacans
which are often built into vor stations
such stations are called vortacs
because tacans include distance measuring equipment
vor
dme and vortac stations are identical in navigation potential to civil aircraft
radar
radar
radio detection and ranging
detects objects at a distance by bouncing radio waves off them
the delay caused by the echo measures the distance
the direction of the beam determines the direction of the reflection
the polarization and frequency of the return can sense the type of surface
navigational radars scan a wide area two to four times per minute
they use very short waves that reflect from earth and stone
they are common on commercial ships and long
distance commercial aircraft
general purpose radars generally use navigational radar frequencies
but modulate and polarize the pulse so the receiver can determine the type of surface of the reflector
the best general
purpose radars distinguish the rain of heavy storms
as well as land and vehicles
some can superimpose sonar data and map data from gps position
search radars scan a wide area with pulses of short radio waves
they usually scan the area two to four times a minute
sometimes search radars use the doppler effect to separate moving vehicles from clutter
targeting radars use the same principle as search radar but scan a much smaller area far more often
usually several times a second or more
weather radars resemble search radars
but use radio waves with circular polarization and a wavelength to reflect from water droplets
some weather radar use the doppler effect to measure wind speeds

satellite radio
digital audio broadcasting
the oldest form of digital broadcast was spark gap telegraphy
used by pioneers such as marconi
by pressing the key
the operator could send messages in morse code by energizing a rotating commutating spark gap
the rotating commutator produced a tone in the receiver
where a simple spark gap would produce a hiss
indistinguishable from static
spark gap transmitters are now illegal
because their transmissions span several hundred megahertz
this is very wasteful of both radio frequencies and power
the next advance was continuous wave telegraphy
or cw
continuous wave
in which a pure radio frequency
produced by a vacuum tube electronic oscillator was switched on and off by a key
a receiver with a local oscillator would
heterodyne
with the pure radio frequency
creating a whistle
like audio tone
cw uses less than
hz of bandwidth
cw is still used
these days primarily by amateur radio operators

radio teletypes usually operate on short
wave
hf
and are much loved by the military because they create written information without a skilled operator
they send a bit as one of two tones
groups of five or seven bits become a character printed by a teletype
from about
to
radio teletype was how most commercial messages were sent to less developed countries
these are still used by the military and weather services
aircraft use a
baud radioteletype service over vhf to send their id
altitude and position
and get gate and connecting
flight data
microwave dishes on satellites
telephone exchanges and tv stations usually use quadrature amplitude modulation
qam
qam sends data by changing both the phase and the amplitude of the radio signal
engineers like qam because it packs the most bits into a radio signal when given an exclusive
non
shared
fixed narrowband frequency range
usually the bits are sent in
frames
that repeat
a special bit pattern is used to locate the beginning of a frame
modern gps receivers
communication systems that limit themselves to a fixed narrowband frequency range are vulnerable to jamming
a variety of jamming
resistant spread spectrum techniques were initially developed for military use
most famously for global positioning system satellite transmissions
commercial use of spread spectrum began in the
bluetooth
most cell phones
and the
b version of wi
fi each use various forms of spread spectrum
systems that need reliability
or that share their frequency with other services
may use
coded orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing
or cofdm
cofdm breaks a digital signal into as many as several hundred slower subchannels
the digital signal is often sent as qam on the subchannels
modern cofdm systems use a small computer to make and decode the signal with digital signal processing
which is more flexible and far less expensive than older systems that implemented separate electronic channels
cofdm resists fading and ghosting because the narrow
channel qam signals can be sent slowly
an adaptive system
or one that sends error
correction codes can also resist interference
because most interference can affect only a few of the qam channels
cofdm is used for wi

heating
radio
frequency energy generated for heating of objects is generally not intended to radiate outside of the generating equipment
to prevent interference with other radio signals
microwave ovens use intense radio waves to heat food
diathermy equipment is used in surgery for sealing of blood vessels
induction furnaces are used for melting metal for casting
and induction hobs for cooking
amateur radio service

amateur radio
also known as
ham radio
is a hobby in which enthusiasts are licensed to communicate on a number of bands in the radio frequency spectrum non
commercially and for their own enjoyment
they may also provide emergency and public service assistance
this has been very beneficial in emergencies
saving lives in many instances
radio amateurs use a variety of modes
including nostalgic ones like morse code and experimental ones like low

radio remote controls use radio waves to transmit control data to a remote object as in some early forms of guided missile
some early tv remotes and a range of model boats
cars and airplanes
large industrial remote
